The code contained in this archive is a reserach prototype (meaning the code is extremely ugly) and is provided "as is" without any guarantees that it will work at all (i.e. I will not provide any support).

The archive contains a Visual Studio 2005 solution which should be able to compile the code. With some small modifications it should be possible to make all this run under Linux.

Use keys 1 and 2 to switch between different line profiles (circular and rotating rectangular), and keys 4-6 to switch between different diffuse textures for the lines.

The code is part of the paper 

"Visualization with stylized line primitives"
Carsten Stoll, Stefan Gumhold and Hans-Peter Seidel
IEE Visualization 2005

which can be found here :

If you use any of the code in research, please cite this paper.
