acm721078	An Operator Interaction Framework for Visualization Systems	acm647341	Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE Symposium Information Visualization	63	70	information visualization, operators, user interactions,view/value, framework, spreadsheet, design, extensibility, visualization systems	2	P74503	10-19-1998	31	Information visualization encounters a wide variety of different data domains. The visualization community has developed representation methods and interactive techniques. As a community, we have realized that the requirements in each domain are often dramatically different. In order to easily apply existing methods, researchers have developed a semiology of graphic representations. We have extended this research into a framework that includes operators and interactions in visualization systems, such as a visualization spreadsheet. We discuss properties of this framework and use it to characterize operations spanning a variety of different visualization techniques. The framework developed in this paper enables a new way of exploring and evaluating the design space of visualization operators, and helps end--users in their analysis tasks.

IVORY is especially designed for information visualization applications and multidimensional graph layout. It is fully implemented in Java 1.1 and its architecture features client-server setup, which allows to run the visualization even on thin clients. In addition, VRML 2.0 exports can be viewed by any VRML plugged-in WWW-browser. Individual visual metaphors are invoked into IVORY via an advanced plug-in mechanism, where plug-ins can be implemented by any experienced user. The configuration of IVORY is accomplished using a script language, called IVML. Some interactive visualization examples, such as the integration of an haptic interface illustrate the performance and versatility of our system. Our current implementation supports NT 4.0

While free-form text is a rich, common source of information, visualization of text is a challenging problem since text is inherently non-spatial. This paper explores the use of implicit surface models for visualizing text. We describe several techniques for text visualization that aid in understanding document content and document relationships. A simple method is defined for mapping document content to shape. By comparing the shapes of multiple documents, global content similarities and differences may be noted. In addition, we describe a visual clustering method in which documents are arranged in 3D based upon similarity scoring. Documents deemed closely related blend together as a single connected shape. Hence, a document corpus becomes a collection of shapes that reflect inter-document relationships. These techniques provide methods to visualize individual documents as well as corpus meta-data. We then combine the two techniques to produce transparent clusters enclosing individual document shapes. This provides a way to visualize both local and global contextual information. Finally, we elaborate on several potential applications of these methods.

In this paper we consider two aggregation methods that are tightly coupled with interactive manipulation and the visual representation of the data. Through this integration we hope to provide effective support for the aggregation process, specifically by enabling: 1) automatic aggregation, 2) continuous change and control of the aggregation level, 3) spatially based aggregates, 4) context maintenance across different aggregate levels, and 5) feedback on the level of aggregation.

Fold predictions are low resolution; no effort is made to rotate the protein's component amino acid side chains into their correct spatial orientations. Rather, the goal is to recognize the protein family member that most closely resembles the target sequence of unknown structure and to create a sensible alignment of the target to the structure (i.e., a structure-sequence alignment). To complement this structure prediction method we have implemented a low resolution molecular graphics tool. Since amino acid side chain orientation is not relevant in fold recognition, amino acid residues are represented by abstract shapes or glyphs much like Lego (tm) blocks. We also borrow techniques from comparative streamline visualization to provide clean depictions of the entire protein structure model. By creating a low resolution representation of protein structure, we are able to approximately double the amount of information on the screen. This implementation also possesses the advantage of eliminating distracting and possibly misleading visual clutter resulting from the mapping of protein alignment information onto a high resolution display of a known structure.

In this paper, we describe a systematic approach to arrange the dimensions according to their similarity. The basic idea is to rearrange the data dimensions such that dimensions showing a similar behavior are positioned next to each other. For the similarity clustering of dimensions we need to define similarity measures which determine the partial or global similarity of dimensions. We then consider the problem of finding an optimal one- or two-dimensional arrangement of the dimensions based on their similarity. Theoretical considerations show that both, the one- and the two-dimensional arrangement problem are surprisingly hard problems, i.e. they are NP-complete. Our solution of the problem is therefore based on heuristic algorithms. An empirical evaluation using a number of different visualization techniques shows the high impact of our similarity clustering of dimensions on the visualization results.

We present a conceptual model and a system, VADE, that realizes this model. Since in asynchronous distributed systems there is no way of knowing (let alone, visualizing) the ``real'' execution, we show how to generate a visualization which is consistent with the execution of the distributed algorithm. We also present the design and implementation of our system. VADE is designed so that the algorithm runs on the server's machines while the visualization is executed on a web page on the client's machine. Programmers can write animations quickly and easily with the assistance of VADE's libraries.

They are induced by machine learning algorithms. A decision table consists of a hierarchical table in which each entry in a higher level table gets broken down by the values of a pair of additional attributes to form another table. The structure is similar to dimensional stacking. Presented here is a visualization method that allows a model based on many attributes to be understood even by those unfamiliar with machine learning. Various forms of interaction are used to make this visualization more useful than other static designs.

In RDT, each node is associated with a disc around which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in several ways:(1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded region by the foreground objects, (2) compact disc tree which can increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen, and (3) plane disc tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT (Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc Tree). It provides 2D and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of displayed nodes on a screen. number of identifiable nodes.

IVEE imports database relations and automatically creates environments holding visualizations and query devices. IVEE offers multiple visualizations such as maps and starfields, and multiple query devices, such as sliders, alphasliders, and toggles. Arbitrary graphical objects can be attached to database objects in visualizations. Multiple visualizations may be active simultaneously. Users can interactively lay out and change between types of query devices. Users may retrieve details-on-demand by clicking on visualization objects. An HTML file may be provided along with the database, specifying how details-on-demand information should be presented, allowing for presentation of multimedia information in database objects. Finally, multiple IVEE clients running on separate workstations on a network can communicate by letting one user's actions affect the visualization in an another IVEE client.

Its methods offer a high degree of selectivity, in choosing object sets, in the selection of interactive techniques and the properties they affect, and in the degree to which a user action affects the visualization. Our goal is to provide a flexible set of techniques and feedback mechanisms that enable users to move objects and transform their appearance to perform a variety of information analysis tasks.

But before VR can realize this potential, we need to solve a number of problems. One of these problems: the user's need to see and interact with non-geometric information is examined. Our VR environment, RealEyes, can display large-scale and detailed geometry at reasonable frame rates (&lt;20 Hz) allowing a user to see and navigate within a design from a first person perspective. However, much (if not most) of the information associated with a particular design has no geometric representation. This includes information such as schematics of electrical, hydraulic, and plumbing systems; information describing materials or processes; and descriptive (textual) information of other types. Many researchers have developed a wealth of techniques for presenting such data on flat-screen displays, but until recently, we have not had a means for naturally displaying such information within a VR environment. To make non-geometric data more available, we have implemented a version of Mosaic that functions within a fully immersive VR system. Our system, VRMosaic, allows a user of VR to access and display most of the data available using flat screen Mosaic. Moreover, we have made it extensible to allow for the seamless integration of specialized forms of data and interaction. This paper describes how we implemented VRMosaic using a VR-capable version of Interviews, It also describes some Mosaic-like uses of that system and some "non-Mosaic-like" extensions.

The application arena is large text document corpora such as digital libraries, regulations and procedures, archived reports, etc. The basic idea is that text content from these sources may be transformed to a spatial representation that preserves informational characteristics from the documents. The spatial representation may then be visually browsed and analyzed in ways that avoid language processing and that reduce the analysts mental workload. The result is an interaction with text that more nearly resembles perception and action with the natural world than with the abstractions of written language.

We have developed a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces. The key concept is the use of an information mural, a two-dimensional reduced representation of an entire information space that fits completely within a display window or screen. Information murals use grayscale shading and color along with anti-aliasing techniques to create a miniature version of the entire data set. By incorporating navigational capabilities, information murals become a tool that can be used as a global view along with more detailed informational displays. Information murals are utilized in our software visualization research to help depict the execution of object-oriented programs, and can also be used in more general information visualization applications.

The traditional node and link network displays work well for small datasets but become visually cluttered and uninterpretable for large datasets. A natural 3D metaphor for displaying world-wide network data is to position the nodes on a globe and draw arcs between them coding the traffic. This technique has several advantages of over the traditional 2D displays, it naturally reduces line crossing clutter, provides an intuitive model for navigation and indication of time, and retains the geographic context. Coupling these strengths with some novel interaction techniques involving the globe surface translucency and arc heights illustrates the usefulness for this class of displays.

Search tools exist that allow users to find relevant information. However, a search can often produce such a large amount of data that it becomes hard to ferret out the most appropriate and highest quality information. In addition, some search tools lose valuable information when displaying the results to the user. The paper describes a search visualization tool, called FISH, for viewing hierarchically structured information and managing information overload. FISH (Forager for the Information Super Highway) allows users to visualize the results of search requests across large document spaces in a way that preserves the structure of the information space. FISH displays the returned documents as rectangles, using a combination of order, indentation, size, and color to denote document hierarchy, the score of the documents with respect to the search, and other data attributes. In addition, the user can navigate through the document space for in-depth probing and refinement.

The scope for visualisation of Gopher and WWW spaces is restricted by the limitations of their respective data models. The far richer data model supported by the Hyper-G Internet information system is exploited by its Harmony client to provide a number of tightly-coupled, two- and three-dimensional visualisation and navigational facilities, which help provide location feedback and alleviate user disorientation.

The need is driven by the growing number of domains where there is a requirement for users to understand, navigate and manipulate large sets of computer based data; by the increasing size and complexity of this information and by the pressures to use this information efficiently. The paradigmatic example is the World Wide Web, but other domains include software systems, information systems and concurrent engineering. One approach to providing this support is to provide sophisticated visualisation tools which lead the users to form an intuitive understanding of the structure and behaviour of their domain and which provide mechanisms which allow them to manipulate objects within their system. The paper describes such a tool and a number of visualisation techniques that it implements.

The process of interacting with information resources starts with browsing, continues with digesting and assimilating pieces of information, terminates with generation of new information, and begins anew with analysis of pre-existing and new information. Our approach is user-centric-taking users needs into account by allowing them to interact with the information contained in large arrays of documents. The visualization process is an integral part of the overall process. We have covered three related categories in this methodology. The first one is browsing through the World-Wide Web (WWW) hyperspace without becoming lost, based on a visual representation of the hyperspace hierarchical structure (hyperspace view). The second category is overcoming the rigidity of the WWW by allowing the user to construct interactively and visually a personal hyperspace of information, linking the documents according to the application or problem domain, or to the user's own perception, experience, culture, or way of thinking. The third category includes discovery and analysis of new information and relationships in retrieved documents by aggregating relevant information and representing it visually.

Treating parent images prior to reduction with edge-detecting smoothing, lossy image compression, or static codebook compression resulted in thumbnails where the distortion caused by reduction was lessened. An experiment assessing these techniques found resulting thumbnails could be recognised more quickly and accurately than thumbnails of the same parent images that had been reduced without treatment. This pretreatment in thumbnail creation is offered as an improvement.

We have a functional notion of aesthetics and therefore understand meaningfulness as a central issue for information visualization. This implies that the diagrams should communicate the characteristics of the data as effectively as possible. In this generative theory of diagram design, we include data characterization, systematic use of graphical means of expression and the combination of graphical means of expression. After giving a brief introduction and an application scenario we discuss these aspects in detail. Finally, a process model of an automatic visualization process is sketched and directions for further research are outlined.

These were specifically created to support engineering artifact design and similar tasks in which a set of parameter values must be chosen to lead to acceptable artifact performance. These tools combine two concepts. One is the interactive and virtually immediate responsive display of data in a manner conducive to the acquisition of insight. The other, involving the precalculation of samples of artifact performance, facilitates smooth exploration and optimisation leading to a design decision. The anticipated benefits of these visualisation tools are illustrated by an example taken from electronic circuit design, in which full account must be taken of the uncertainties in parameter values arising from inevitable variations in the manufacturing process.

But this promising approach requires the capability of an automatic layout system because the tedious and time consuming task of a manual layout leads to a rejection of this approach by the user. In our approach, we split the task of retrieving information into two phases that are getting the orientation within the network and reading currently visited information. We present layout algorithms for both phases which have the benefit of being flexible and adaptable to individual user requests and ensure the topological consistency, i.e. the stability of the topology of the information layout during a sequence of display layouts. The results show that especially the possibility of an animation of the layout process can assist the user essentially in maintaining the orientation in the information network.

It is possible to display an entire securities market, like the S&amp;P 500, on a single screen. With the correct approach to the visual design of the layout, these massive amounts of information can be quickly and easily comprehended by a human observer. By using motion and animated interaction, it is possible to use 3D as a reliable, accurate and precise decision-support tool. Information animation applications are particularly suited to the securities industry because that is where we find huge amounts of data, the value of which declines rapidly with time, and where critical decisions are being made on this data in very short periods of time. Information animation technology is an important new tool for the securities industry, where people need to be in the decision-making loop without suffering from information overload. Several examples are discussed including equity trading analytics, fixed income trading analytics and fixed-income risk viewing.

Existing systems for visualizing huge hierarchies using cone trees "break down" once the hierarchy to be displayed exceeds roughly 1000 nodes, due to increasing visual clutter. The paper describes a system called fsviz which visualizes arbitrarily large hierarchies while retaining user control. This is accomplished by augmenting cone trees with several graphical and interaction techniques: usage-based filtering, animated zooming, hand-coupled rotation, fish-eye zooming, coalescing of distant nodes, texturing, effective use of colour for depth cueing, and the applications of dynamic queries. The fsviz system also improves upon earlier cone tree visualization systems through a more elaborate node layout algorithm. This algorithm enhances the usefulness of cone tree visualization for large hierarchies by all but eliminating clutter.

DataSpace utilizes the display space by placing panels of information, possibly generated by different visualization applications, in a 3-D graph layout, and providing continuous navigation facilities. Selective rearrangements and transparency can be used to reduce occlusion or to compare or merge a set of images (e.g. line graphs or scatter plots) that are aligned and stacked in depth. A prototype system supporting the basic 3-D graphic operations (layout, zoom, rotation, translation, transparency) has been implemented. We provide several illustrative examples of DataSpace displays taken from the current system. We present the 3-D display paradigm, describe the query, layout and rendering steps required to create a display, and discuss some performance issues.

The system, SFA, uses glyph-based volume rendering, enabling more information attributes to be visualized than traditional 2D and surface-based information visualization systems. Two-handed interaction and stereoscopic viewing combine to produce a minimally immersive interactive system that enhances the user's three-dimensional perception of the information space, capitalizing on the human visual system's pre-attentive learning capabilities to quickly analyze the displayed information. The paper describes the usefulness of this system for the visualization of document similarity within a corpus of textual documents. SFA allows the three-dimensional volumetric visualization, manipulation, navigation, and analysis of multivariate, time-varying information spaces, increasing the quantity and clarity of information conveyed from the visualization as compared to traditional 2D information systems.

Interactive visualization of these databases is difficult because of the large amount of data involved. We present a method of summarizing large databases which is well suited to interactive visualization. We illustrate this with a visualization tool for the domain of call billing data.

Our system permits the user to define arithmetic and presentation relationships amongst the various cells of the spreadsheet. The cells contain primitives that can be numbers, text, images, functions and graphics. Presenting financial information in this format allows its intended clients, the financial analysts, to work in the familiar environment of a spreadsheet and allows them the flexibility afforded by the powerful interface of the spreadsheet paradigm. In addition, our system permits real-time visualization of the financial data stream allowing its user to visually trade the changing market trends in two and three dimensions.

Most, if not all, are limited by the number of dimensions which can be effectively displayed. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an iterative non-linear technique for projecting n-D data down to a lower number of dimensions. This work presents extensions to MDS that enhance visualization of high-dimensional data sets. These extensions include animation, stochastic perturbation, and flow visualization techniques.

In particular the Harmony Information Landscape visualises the hierarchical structure of Hyper-G spaces upon a plane in three-dimensional space. The Harmony Information Landscape has now been extended to display a combined structure and link map by selectively superimposing hyperlink relationships in the vertical dimension above and below the hierarchy map. In addition, documents returned by search queries may be selectively "plotted" in the landscape, indicating their whereabouts in a broader context, and several sets of 3D icons are available for representing the various document types.

However, if the user's query results in lots of records to be retrieved, just listing the results is not very user-friendly. We are developing a system that allows the visualization of the results. Visualizations of both text and image search are generated on the fly based on the search results.

In addition, piecewise linear methods are introduced which allow greater efficiency and expressiveness than their continuous counterparts.

Effective visualizations make important features of the data immediately recognizable and enable the user to discover interesting and useful results by highlighting patterns. A key element of such systems is the ability to interact with displays of data by selecting a subset for further investigation. This operation is needed for use in linked-views systems and in drill-down analysis. It is a common manipulation in many other systems. It is as ubiquitous as selecting icons in a desktop GUI. It is therefore surprising to note that little research has been done on how selection can be implemented. This paper addresses this omission, presenting a taxonomy for selection mechanisms and discussing the interactions between branches of the taxonomy. Our suggestion of 524,288 possible systems [2/sup 16/ operation systems/spl times/2 (memory/memoryless)/spl times/2 (data-dependent/independent)/spl times/2 (brush/lasso)] is more in fun than serious, as within the taxonomy there are many different choices that can be made. This framework is the result of considering both the current state of the art and historical antecedents.

Much work has been done in developing tools for 2D spaces which allow for detail in context views. We examine the extension of such 2D methods to 3D and explore the limitations encountered in accessing internal regions of the data with these methods. We then describe a novel solution to this problem of internal access with the introduction of a distortion function which creates a clear line of sight to the focus revealing sections previously obscured. The distortion is symmetric about the line of sight and is smoothly integrated back into the original 3D layout.

We use competition trees to organize the information of a tennis match and visualize the competition trees by the top-nesting layered maps with translucent colored layers. We create iconic representations to describe the detailed information of athletic events in an intuitive manner. Specialized views of the information are displayed by applying multiple Magic Lens filters on the top-nesting layered maps. The dynamic nature of the tennis match is depicted by the time-varying display. The approach we present in this paper can be used to visualize other sports information, information with competition property, or information with hierarchical structure.

The system is built around two separate neural network methodologies: context vectors and self-organizing maps. Context vectors (CVs) are high dimensional information representations that encode the semantic content of the textual entities they represent. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are capable of transforming an input, high dimensional signal space into a much lower (usually two or three) dimensional output space useful for visualization. Neither process requires human intervention, nor an external knowledge base. Together, these neural network techniques can be utilized to automatically identify the relevant information themes present in a corpus, and present those themes to the user in a intuitive visual form.

MEL uses the World Wide Web (WWW) to make accessible distributed data whose metadata conform to the Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) content standards for digital geospatial metadata. The interfaces are implemented as Java/sup TM/ applets and are more intuitive, interactive and possess greater functionality than their Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) counterparts. As well as querying, the interface allows users to visualize and manage the list of query results so that users can more quickly discover the datasets of real interest. Several new tools used to visualize attributes of the metadata are presented.

These logs capture information at the key press and mouse click level about how an application is used. Since the raw data is voluminous and not at a useful level of detail, we use analysis and visualization to find information that is interesting and useful to a usability analyst but was previously buried in the data. We call some of our custom visualizations "contextual" meaning they use key elements of the context the data was collected in as an organizing structure. We expect this type of visualization to be easier and faster to understand and more helpful than traditional charts. We hope that our finding a natural geometry for these visualizations will inspire others whose data apparently has no inherent geometry to find natural ways to visualize their data.

The MBone is the Internet's multicast backbone. Multicast is the most efficient way of distributing data from one sender to multiple receivers with minimal packet duplication. Developed and initially deployed by researchers within the Internet community, the MBone has been extremely popular for efficient transmission across the Internet of real-time video and audio streams such as conferences, meetings, congressional sessions, and NASA shuttle launches. The MBone, like the Internet itself grew exponentially with no central authority. The resulting suboptimal topology is of growing concern to network providers and the multicast research community. We create a geographic representation of the tunnel structure as arcs on a globe by resolving the latitude and longitude of MBone routers. The interactive 3D maps permit an immediate understanding of the global structure unavailable from the data in its original form as lines of text with only hostnames and IP addresses. Data visualization techniques such as grouping and thresholding allow further analysis of specific aspects of the MBone topology. We distribute the interactive 3D maps through the World-Wide Web using the VRML file format thus allowing network maintainers throughout the world to analyze the structure move effectively than would be possible with still pictures or pre-made videos.

When building such a system, it is important to thoroughly understand the presentation-related characteristics of domain-specific information. We define a data-analysis taxonomy that can be used to characterize heterogeneous information. In addition to capturing the presentation-related properties of data, our characterization takes into account the user's information-seeking goals and visual-interpretation preferences. We use automatically-generated examples from two different application domains to demonstrate the coverage of the proposed taxonomy and its utility for selecting effective graphical techniques.

It represents an approach to coordinating multiple visualizations, analysis and presentation tools in data-intensive domains. Visage is based on an information-centric approach to user interface design which strives to eliminate impediments to direct user access to information objects across applications and visualizations. Visage consists of a set of data manipulation operations, an intelligent system for generating a wide variety of data visualizations (SAGE) and a briefing tool that supports the conversion of visual displays used during exploration into interactive presentation slides. This paper presents the user interface components and styles of interaction that are central to Visage's information-centric approach.

VANISH supports rapid prototyping through a special-purpose visual language called VaPL (VANISH Programming Language) tailored for visualizations, through a software architecture that insulates visualization-specific code from changes in both the domain being visualized and the presentation toolkit used, and through the reuse of visualization techniques between application domains. The generality of VANISH is established by showing how it is able to re-create a wide variety of "standard" visualization techniques. VANISH's support for prototyping is shown through an extended example, where we build a C++ class browser, exploring many visualization alternatives in the process.

This is especially true for large data sets or complex 3D visualizations. Although many new types of interaction have been introduced recently, very little work has been done on understanding what their components are, how they are related and how they can be combined. This paper begins to address these issues with a framework for classifying interactive visualizations. Our goal is a framework that will enable us to develop toolkits for assembling visualization interfaces both interactively and automatically.

The system is based on a quantification of the similarity of related objects that governs the parameters of a mass-spring system. Unlike existing approaches we initialize all information units onto the inner surface of two concentric spheres and attach them with springs to the outer sphere. Since the spring stiffnesses correspond to the computed similarity measures, the system converges into an energy minimum which reveals multidimensional relations and adjacencies in terms of spatial neighborhoods. Depending on the application scenario our approach supports different topological arrangements of related objects. In order to cope with large data sets we propose a blobby clustering mechanism that enables encapsulation of similar objects by implicit shapes. In addition, we implemented various interaction techniques allowing semantic analysis of the underlying data sets. Our prototype system IVORY is written in JAVA, and its versatility is illustrated by an example from financial service providers.

We propose two graphical interfaces, the CVI and the RF-Cone. The CVI is the interface for interactive viewpoint selection. We can select a viewpoint reflecting our interests by using the CVI. According to the given viewpoint, the RF-Cone adaptively organizes the 3D representation of the hypermedia so that we can understand the semantic and structural relationship of the hypermedia and easily retrieve the information. Combining these methods, we have developed the WWW visualization system which can provide highly efficient navigation.

We discuss the general utility of a novel visualization spreadsheet framework. Just as a numerical spreadsheet enables exploration of numbers, a visualization spreadsheet enables exploration of visual forms of information. We show that the spreadsheet approach facilitates certain information visualization tasks that are more difficult using other approaches. Unlike traditional spreadsheets, which store only simple data elements and formulas in each cell, a visualization spreadsheet cell can hold an entire complex data set, selection criteria, viewing specifications, and other information needed for a full-fledged information visualization. Similarly, inter-cell operations are far more complex, stretching beyond simple arithmetic and string operations to encompass a range of domain-specific operators. We have built two prototype systems that illustrate some of these research issues. The underlying approach in our work allows domain experts to define new data types and data operations, and enables visualization experts to incorporate new visualizations, viewing parameters, and view operations.

We can lay out much larger structures than can be handled using traditional techniques for drawing general graphs because we assume a hierarchical nature of the data. We impose a hierarchy on the graph by using domain-specific knowledge to find an appropriate spanning tree. Links which are not part of the spanning tree do not influence the layout but can be selectively drawn by user request. The volume of hyperbolic 3-space increases exponentially, as opposed to the familiar geometric increase of euclidean 3-space. We exploit this exponential amount of room by computing the layout according to the hyperbolic metric. We optimize the cone tree layout algorithm for 3D hyperbolic space by placing children on a hemisphere around the cone mouth instead of on its perimeter. Hyperbolic navigation affords a Focus+Context view of the structure with minimal visual clutter. We have successfully laid out hierarchies of over 20,000 nodes. Our implementation accommodates navigation through graphs too large to be rendered interactively by allowing the user to explicitly prune or expand subtrees.

This is the basis for the application to visual data mining. The knowledge discovery process together with some general guidelines are illustrated on a dataset from the production of a VLSI chip. The special strength of parallel coordinates is in modeling relations. As an example, a simplified economic model is constructed with data from various economic sectors of a real country. The visual model shows the interelationship and dependencies between the sectors, circumstances where there is competition for the same resource, and feasible economic policies. Interactively, the model can be used to do trade-off analyses, discover sensitivities, do approximate optimization, monitor (as in a process) and provide decision support.

It is now appropriate to describe and analyze portions of the design space so as to understand the differences among designs and to suggest new possibilities. This paper proposes an organization of the information visualization literature and illustrates it with a series of examples. The result is a framework for designing new visualizations and augmenting existing designs.

However limitations in expressive power of current visualization systems force users to go outside the system and form a new dataset in order to perform certain operations, such as those involving the relationship among multiple objects. Further, there is no support for integrating data from the new dataset into previous visualizations, so users must recreate them. Visage's information centric paradigm provides an architectural hook for linking data across multiple queries, removing this overhead. This paper describes the addition to Visage of a visual query language, called VQE, which allows users to express more complicated queries than in previous interactive visualization systems. Visualizations can be created from queries and vice versa. When either is updated, the other changes to maintain consistency.

We present a new incremental approach to DQI algorithms and display updates that works well with large databases, both in theory and in practice.

Plotting difficulties that arise from large numbers of data points, categorical variables, interaction with non-axis dimensions, and unknown values, are addressed by this method. The domain of the plot is voxelized using binning and then volume rendered. Since a table is used as the underlying data structure, no storage is wasted on regions with no data. The opacity of each voxel is a function of the number of data points in a corresponding bin. A voxel's color is derived by averaging the value of one of the variables for all the data points that fall in a bin. Other variables in the data may be mapped to external query sliders. A dragger object permits a user to select regions inside the volume.

We describe recent work on both aspects of the system, in particular a generalization of the data types laid out and the implementation of imageability features in a 2D visualization tool. The variety of data analyzed in a financial institution such as UBS, and the ubiquity of spreadsheets as a medium for analysis, led us to extend our layout tools to handle data in a generic spreadsheet format. We describe the metrics of similarity used for this data type, and give examples of layouts of sets of records of financial trades. Conservatism and scepticism with regard to 3D visualization, along with the lack of functionality of widely available 3D web browsers, led to the development of a 2D visualization tool with refinements of a number of our imageability features.

The technique integrates both pan+zoom and fisheye-view visualization approaches for exploring a nested graph view of software structure. The fisheye-view approach handles multiple focal points, which are necessary when examining several subsystems and their mutual interconnections. Source code is presented by embedding code fragments within the nodes of the nested graph. Finer connections among these fragments are represented by a network that is navigated using a hypertext link-following metaphor. SHriMP combines this hypertext metaphor with animated panning and zooming motions over the nested graph to provide continuous orientation and contextual cues for the user. The SHriMP tool is currently being evaluated in several user studies. Observations of users performing program understanding tasks with the tool are discussed.

Such a system is a necessary foundation for using visualization as an aid to software understanding. The system supports an arbitrary set of data sources so that information from both static and dynamic analysis can be combined to offer meaningful software visualizations. It provides the user with a visual universal-relation front end that supports the definition of queries over multiple data sources without knowledge of the structure or contents of the sources. It uses a flexible back end with a range of different visualizations, most geared to the efficient display of large amounts of data. The result is a high-quality, easy-to-define program visualization that can address specific problems and hence is useful for software understanding. The overall system is flexible and extensible in that both the underlying data model and the set of visualizations are defined in resource files.

Although new technologies have made it possible to automatically collect data on project resources, it is very difficult to access this data because of its size and lack of structure. We present three novel glyphs for simplifying this process and apply them to visualizing statistics from a multi-million line software project. These glyphs address four important needs in project management: 1) Viewing time dependent data; 2) Managing large data volumes; 3) Dealing with diverse data types and 4) Correspondence of data to "real-world" concepts.

In the original Table Lens design, data are shown in the context area using graphical representations in a single pixel row. Scaling up the Table Lens technique beyond approximately 500 cases (rows) by 40 variables (columns) requires not showing every value individually and thus raises challenges for preserving the exploratory and navigational ease and power of the original design. We describe two design enhancements for introducing regions of less than a pixel row for each data value and discuss the issues raised by each.

This new representation provides ease of manipulation and power of expression. By removing the restrictions of explicit foci and allowing precise specification of magnification values, we can achieve magnification effects which were not previously possible. Of particular interest are techniques we introduce for expressing complex and subtle magnification effects through magnification brushing, and allowing intrinsic properties of the data being visualized to create data-driven magnifications.

We are carrying out a series of experiments to evaluate the usefulness of this type of visualization as an image browsing aid. The initial experiment, described in this paper, considered whether people would find a given photograph more quickly in a visualization than in a randomly arranged grid of images. The results show that the subjects were faster with the visualization, although in post-experiment interviews many of them said that they preferred the clarity and regularity of the grid. We describe an algorithm with which the best aspects of the two layout types can be combined.

We found that animation improves users' ability to reconstruct the information space, with no penalty on task performance time. We believe that this study provides strong evidence for adding animated transitions in many applications with fixed spatial data where the user navigates around the data space.

DADV was used to design the data visualization in VisEIO-LCA, which is a framework to visualize environmental data about products.Most of the visualizations are designed using the following stages: formatting data in tables, selecting visual structures, and rendering the data on the screen. Although many visualizations authors perform implicit domain analysis, in this paper domain analysis is added explicitly to the process of designing visualizations with the goal of producing more usable software tools. Environmental Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used as a test bed for this technique.

In this way, the system firstly visualizes a spreadsheet on a plane in three-dimensional space, and draws arcs between interrelated cells. By allowing a user to select an arbitrary cell and lift it up with direct manipulation, the system utilizes the third dimension to ameliorate visual occlusion of crossing arcs. As the user lifts a focused cell up, the interrelated cells are lifted up together; thus hidden data-flow networks can be visually intelligible interactively. Because spreadsheets intend to calculation itself rather than appearances of outputs, their mechanism is relatively invisible and not obvious for ordinary users. Our visualization helps such users to understand structures and mechanism of spreadsheets.

Such hierarchies allow a user to embed important semantic information into the hierarchy definition. Our goal is to recognize the significance of this implicit information and to utilize it in the hierarchy visualization. The innovative features of our system include the dynamic modification of the hierarchy definitions and the definition and implementation of a set of layout algorithms that utilize semantic information implicit in the tree construction.

Brushing, a popular method for implementing the selection process, has traditionally been performed in either screen space or data space. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a structure-based brush, which can be used to perform selection in hierarchically structured data sets. Our structure-based brush allows users to navigate hierarchies by specifying focal extents and level-of-detail on a visual representation of the structure. Proximity-based coloring, which maps similar colors to data that are closely related within the structure, helps convey both structural relationships and anomalies. We describe the design and implementation of our structure-based brushing tool. We also validate its usefulness using two distinct hierarchical visualization techniques, namely hierarchical parallel coordinates and tree-maps.

Cushion treemaps inherit the elegance of standard treemaps: compact, space-filling displays of hierarchical information, based on recursive subdivision of a rectangular image space. Intuitive shading is used to provide insight in the hierarchical structure.During the subdivision ridges are added per rectangle, which are rendered with a simple shading model. The result is a surface that consists of recursive cushions. The method is efficient, effective, easy to use and implement, and has a wide applicability.

The problem addressed here is how to identify patterns and trends on multiple time scales (days, weeks, seasons) simultaneously. The solution presented is to cluster similar daily data patterns, and to visualize the average patterns as graphs and the corresponding days on a calendar. This presentation provides a quick insight into both standard and exceptional patterns. Furthermore, it is well suited to interactive exploration. Two applications, numbers of employees present and energy consumption, are presented.

By sensemaking, we mean interacting with and operating on the information with a variety of information processing mechanisms [3,18]. Previously, we introduced a concept that uses the spreadsheet metaphor with cells containing visualizations of complex data. In this paper, we extend and apply a cognitive model called "visual sensemaking" to the Visualization Spreadsheet. We use the task of making sense of a large Web site as a concrete example through out the paper for demonstration. Using a variety of visualization techniques, such as the Disk Tree and Cone Tree, we show that the interactions of the Visualization Spreadsheet help users draw conclusions from the overall relationships of the entire information set.

In this paper, we describe a visualization system for the analysis of application behavior on superscalar processors. Our system provides an overview-plus-detail display of the application's execution. A timeline view of pipeline performance data shows the overall utilization of the pipeline. This information is displayed using multiple time scales, enabling the user to drill down from a high-level application overview to a focus region of hundreds of cycles. This region of interest is displayed in detail using an animated cycle-by-cycle view of the execution. This view shows how instructions are reordered and executed and how functional units are being utilized. Additional context views correlate instructions in this detailed view with the relevant source code for the application. This allows the user to discover the root cause of the poor pipeline utilization and make changes to the application to improve its performance. This visualization system can be easily configured to display a variety of processor models and configurations. We demonstrate it for both the MXS and MMIX processor models.

Constellation is targeted at helping MindNet's creators and users refine their algorithms, as opposed to understanding the structure of language. We designed a special-purpose graph layout algorithm which exploits higher-level structure in addition to the basic node and edge connectivity. Our layout prioritizes the creation of a semantic space to encode plausibility instead of traditional graph drawing metrics like minimizing edge crossings. We make careful use of several perceptual channels both to minimize the visual impact of edge crossings and to emphasize highlighted constellations of nodes and edges.

A geometrically motivated classifier is presented and applied, with both training and testing stages, to 3 real data-sets. Our results compared to those from 23 other classifiers have the least error. The algorithm is based on parallel coordinates and: has very low computational complexity in the number of variables and the size of the data-set - contrasted with the very high or unknown (often unstated) complexity of other classifiers, the low complexity enables the rule derivation to be done in near real-time hence making the classification adaptive to changing conditions, provides comprehensible and explicit rules - contrasted to neural networks which are "black boxes", does dimensionality selection - where the minimal set of original variables (not transformed new variables as in Principal Component Analysis) required to state the rule is found, orders these variables so as to optimize the clarity of separation between the designated set and its complement - this solves the pesky "ordering problem" in parallel coordinates.The algorithm is display independent, hence it can be applied to very large in size and number of variables data-sets. Though it is instructive to present the results visually, the input size is no longer display-limited as for visual data mining.

For years researchers have developed many tools to visualize association rules. However, few of these tools can handle more than dozens of rules, and none of them can effectively manage rules with multiple antecedents. Thus, it is extremely difficult to visualize and understand the association information of a large data set even when all the rules are available. This paper presents a novel visualization technique to tackle many of these problems. We apply the technology to a text mining study on large corpora. The results indicate that our design can easily handle hundreds of multiple antecedent association rules in a three-dimensional display with minimum human interaction, low occlusion percentage, and no screen swapping.

Quite often users feel lost, confused, and overwhelmed with displays that contain too much information. This paper discusses a new content-driven visual mining infrastructure called VisMine, that uses several innovative techniques: (1) hidden visual structure and relationships for uncluttering displays; (2) simultaneous visual presentations for high-dimensional knowledge discovery; and (3) a new visual interface to plug in existing graphic toolkits for expanding its use in a wide variety of visual applications. We have applied this infrastructure to three data mining visualization applications - topic hierarchy for document navigation, web-based trouble shooting, and telecom switch mining.

Recent work has extended them to data-sets of 100,000 objects and, separately, to queries involving relations among multiple objects. The latter work enables filtering houses by properties of their owners, for instance. Our primary concern is providing feedback from histograms during Dynamic Query. The height of each histogram bar shows the count of selected objects whose attribute value falls into a given range. Unfortunately, previous efficient algorithms for single object queries over count in the case of multiple objects if, for instance, a house has multiple owners. This paper presents an efficient algorithm that with high probability closely approximates the true counts.

In analyzing power systems, one is usually confronted with a large amount of multivariate data. With systems containing tens of thousands of electrical nodes (buses), a key challenge is to present this data in a form so the user can assess the state of the system in an intuitive and quick manner. This is particularly true when trying to analyze relationships between actual network power flows, the scheduled power flows, and the capacity of the transmission system. With electric industry restructuring and the move towards having a single entity, such as an independent system operator or pool, operate a much larger system, this need has become more acute. This paper presents several power system visualization techniques to help in this task. These techniques include animation of power system flow values, contouring of bus and transmission line flow values, data aggregation techniques and interactive 3D data visualization.

As the hierarchy grows in size, many items become small, peripheral slices that are difficult to distinguish. We have developed three visualization/interaction techniques that provide flexible browsing of the display. The techniques allow viewers to examine the small items in detail while providing context within the entire information hierarchy. Additionally, smooth transitions between views help users maintain orientation within the complete information space.

Often, we would like to assign a color or other visual attributes to a node or edge that indicates an associated value. In an application involving divisive clustering, we would like to partition the graph into subsets of graph elements based on metric values in such a way that all subsets are evenly populated. Assuming a uniform distribution of metric values during either partitioning or coloring can have undesired effects such as empty clusters or only one level of emphasis for the entire graph. Probability density functions derived from statistics about a metric can help systems succeed at these tasks.

MGV's only assumption is that the vertex set of the underlying digraph corresponds to the set of leaves of a predetermined tree T. MGV builds an out-of-core graph hierarchy and provides mechanisms to plug in arbitrary visual representations for each graph hierarchy slice. Navigation from one level to another of the hierarchy corresponds to the implementation of a drill-down interface. In order to provide the user with navigation control and interactive response, MGV incorporates a number of visualization techniques like interactive pixel-oriented 2D and 3D maps, statistical displays, multi-linked views, and a zoomable label based interface. This makes the association of geographic information and graph data very natural. MGV follows the client-server paradigm and it is implemented in C and Java-3D. We highlight the main algorithmic and visualization techniques behind the tools and point out along the way several possible application scenarios. Our techniques are being applied to multi-graphs defined on vertex sets with sizes ranging from 100 million to 250 million vertices.

Analysis and exploration tasks place significant demands on the interfaces to these databases. Because of the size of the data sets, dense graphical representations are more effective for exploration than spreadsheets and charts. Furthermore, because of the exploratory nature of the analysis, it must be possible for the analysts to change visualizations rapidly as they pursue a cycle involving first hypothesis and then experimentation.In this paper, we present Polaris, an interface for exploring large multi-dimensional databases that extends the well-known Pivot Table interface. The novel features of Polaris include an interface for constructing visual specifications of table-based graphical displays and the ability to generate a precise set of relational queries from the visual specifications. The visual specifications can be rapidly and incrementally developed, giving the analyst visual feedback as they construct complex queries and visualizations.

To further facilitate understanding and analysis, many visualization environments have special features known as portals, which are sub-windows of a data canvas. Portals provide a way to display multiple graphical representations simultaneously, in a nested fashion. This makes portals an extremely powerful and flexible paradigm for data visualization. Unfortunately, with this flexibility comes complexity. There are over a hundred possible ways each portal can be configured to exhibit different behaviors. Many of these behaviors are confusing and certain behaviors can be inappropriate for a particular setting. It is desirable to eliminate confusing and inappropriate behaviors. In this paper, we construct taxonomy of portal behaviors and give recommendations to help designers of visualization systems decide which behaviors are intuitive and appropriate for a particular setting. We apply these recommendations to an example setting that is fully visually programmable and analyze the resulting reduced set of behaviors. Finally, we consider a real visualization environment and demonstrate some problems associated with behaviors that do not follow our recommendations.

Therefore, systems supporting the users to design appropriate visualizations are of great importance. The GADGET system, which has been developed in our previous study, interactively helps them design scientific visualization applications by presenting appropriate MVE prototypes according to the specification of the visualization goals expressed mainly with the Wehrend matrix. This paper attempts to extend this approach in order to develop a system named GADGET/IV}, which is intended to provide the users with an environment for semi-automatic design of information visualization applications. To this end, a novel goal-oriented taxonomy of information visualization techniques is presented. In addition, an initial design of the system architecture and user assistance flow is described. The usefulness of the GADGET/IV system is illustrated with example problems of Web site access frequency analysis.

Metrics to evaluate visual displays were developed based on measures of information content developed by Shannon and used in communication theory. These measures of information content can be used to quantify the relative effectiveness of displays.
acm857691	A Taxonomy of Visualization Techniques Using the Data State Reference Model	acm857190	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Vizualization 2000 	69	null	Data State Model, Information Visualization, Operators, Reference Model, Taxonomy, Techniques	1	P74502	10-09-2000	8	In previous work, researchers have attempted to construct taxonomies of information visualization techniques by examining the data domains that are compatible with these techniques. This is useful because implementers can quickly identify various techniques that can be applied to their domain of interest. However, these taxonomies do not help the implementers understand how to apply and implement these techniques. In this paper, we will extend and then propose a new way to taxonomize information visualization techniques by using the Data State Model [Chi98]. In fact, as the taxonomic analysis in this paper will show, many of the techniques share similar operating steps that can easily be reused. The paper shows that the Data State Model not only helps researchers understand the space of design, but also helps implementers understand how information visualization techniques can be applied more broadly.
acm857692	From Metaphor to Method: Cartographic Perspectives on Information Visualization	acm857190	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Vizualization 2000 	91	null	Cartographic Generalization, Cartography, Feature Labeling, Information Visualization, Maps	1	P572942	10-09-2000	23	By virtue of their spatio-cognitive abilities, humans are able to navigate through geographic space as well as meaningfully communicate geographic information represented in cartographic form. The current dominance of spatial metaphors in information visualization research is the result of the realization that those cognitive skills also have value in the exploration and analysis of non-geographic information. While mapping or landscape metaphors are routinely used in this field, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for existing cartographic expertise. This is especially apparent whenever problematic issues are encountered, such as graphic complexity or feature labeling. There are a number of areas in which a cartographic outlook could provide a valuable perspective. This paper discusses how geographic and cartographic notions may influence the design of visualizations for textual information spaces. Map projections, generalization, feature labeling and map design issues are discussed.
acm857693	Visualizing Sequential Patterns for Text Mining	acm857190	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Vizualization 2000 	105	null	null	5	P218971	10-09-2000	11	A sequential pattern in data mining is a finite series of elements such as A .B .C .D where A, B, C, and D are elements of the same domain. The mining of sequential patterns is designed to find patterns of discrete events that frequently happen in the same arrangement along a timeline. Like association and clustering, the mining of sequential patterns is among the most popular knowledge discovery techniques that apply statistical measures to extract useful information from large datasets. As our computers become more powerful, we are able to mine bigger datasets and obtain hundreds of thousands of sequential patterns in full detail. With this vast amount of data, we argue that neither data mining nor visualization by itself can manage the information and reflect the knowledge effectively. Subsequently, we apply visualization to augment data mining in a study of sequential patterns in large text corpora. The result shows that we can learn increasingly quickly in an integrated visual data-mining environment.

Using a series of examples ranging from applications for ordinary desktop displays to web-browsers and other applications for PDAs, we describe how a focus+context technique, Flip Zooming, is changed due to the situation it is used in. Based on these examples, we discuss how the use of "focus" and "context" in focus+context techniques change in order to fit new areas of use for information visualization.

The user interface of traditional 3D browsers provides simple navigation tools that allow the user to modify the camera parameters such as orientation, position and focal. Using these tools, it is frequent that, after some movements, the user is lost in the virtual 3D space and usually tries to restart from the beginning.This paper presents how the 3D navigation problem is addressed in the context of the CyberNet project. Our underlying principle is to help the user navigate by adapting the navigation tool to the virtual world. We feel that the navigation schemes provided by the 3D browsers are too generic for some specific 3D tools and we have developed adaptive navigation features that are dependent on the 3D metaphor used for visualizing the information and on the user's task.
acm857698	Interactive Problem Solving via Algorithm Visualization	acm857190	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Vizualization 2000 	145	null	Interactive information visualization, combinatorial search, configuration design, human-computer collaboration	2	P342898	10-09-2000	10	COMIND is a tool for conceptual design of industrial products. It helps designers define and evaluate the initial design space by using search algorithms to generate sets of feasible solutions. Two algorithm visualization techniques, Kaleidoscope and Lattice, and one visualization of n-dimensional data, MAP, are used to externalize the machine's problem solving strategies and the tradeoffs as a result of using these strategies. After a short training period, users are able to discover tactics to explore design space effectively, evaluate new design solutions, and learn important relationships among design criteria, search speed, and solution quality. We thus propose that visualization can serve as a tool for interactive intelligence, i.e., human-machine collaboration for solving complex problems.

Each visualization simultaneously compares one file in the set to all other files in the set. These visualizations, which can be computed in O(n) time and space, are explained and then applied to the problem of detecting plagiarism in large computer science classes. A case study is presented and sample visualizations are provided. Finally, a new interactive tool that can be used to produce and manipulate these visualizations is presented.

A 3D collaborative electronic workspace allows people to configure, save, and browse arrangements of heterogeneous work materials. Spatial arrangements and links are created and maintained as an integral part of ongoing work with "live" documents and objects. The result is an extension of the physical information space of the architects' studio that utilizes the potential of electronic data storage, visualization, and network technologies to support work with information in context.

This enhances a clinician's ability to detect and rapidly respond to critical events. The integrated and intuitive display communicates a patient's cardiovascular state so that it is easily and quickly understood without prior training. The display is designed to show patterns of functional relationships that aid in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of a critical event.

The integrated geographic visualization system was created for the exploratory analysis of mortality data from specific cancers as they relate, specifically spatially, to other mortality causes and to demographic and socioeconomic risk factors. The linked and interactive parallel coordinate plot was tested with and compared to a similarly interactive and linked scatterplot in usability assessments designed to assess each representation's relative effectiveness for exploration of these data sets. Evidence from these studies suggests that multivariate, spatial, and/or time series exploration is enhanced through the use of the parallel coordinate plot linked to maps.

In addition, we introduce techniques for force-directed and orthogonal drawing which use node grouping information and have been shown in experiments to perform better than previous techniques. Not only do these techniques have significantly improved performance with respect to standard aesthetic measures, but they also attain qualitative improvement.

We use the well-known radial tree layout method, in which the view is determined by the selection of a focus node. Our main contribution is a method for animating the transition to a new layout when a new focus node is selected. In order to keep the transition easy to follow, the animation linearly interpolates the polar coordinates of the nodes, while enforcing ordering and orientation constraints. We apply this technique to visualizations of social networks and of the Gnutella file-sharing network, and discuss the results from our informal usability tests.

They can be thought of as visual indices that guide the navigation of a multi-graph too large to fit on the available display. We adhere to the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra: Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand. Graph Sketches are incorporated into MGV, an integrated visualization and exploration system for massive multi-digraph navigation. We highlight the main algorithmic and visualization tasks behind the computation of Graph Sketches and illustrate several application scenarios. Graph Sketches will be used to guide the navigation of multi-digraphs defined on vertex sets with sizes ranging from 100 to 250 million vertices.

Visual information is reduced by clustering nodes, forming a tree structure of related clusters. This structure is visualized in three dimensions with concepts from cone trees and emphasis on symmetry. The resulting visualization makes it easier to relate features in the visualization of the state transition graph to semantic concepts in the corresponding process and vice versa.

Child nodes are mapped on rotating cylinders, which will be dynamically displayed or hidden to achieve a useful balance of detail and context. Besides a comprehensible three-dimensional visualization of trees, the main feature of CCT is a very fast and intuitive interaction with the displayed nodes. Only a single click is needed to reach every node and perform an action on it, such as displaying a web page. The CCT browsing technique was developed for interaction with web hierarchies but is not limited to this domain. We also present sample implementations of CCT using VRML, which show the usefulness of this intuitive tree navigation technique.
acm857709	Botanical Visualization of Huge Hierarchies	acm580582	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2001 (INFOVIS'01) 	87	null	botanical tree, directory tree, huge hierarchy, logical tree, phyllotaxis, strands, tree visualization	3	P573068	10-22-2001	14	A new method for the visualization of huge hierarchical data structures is presented. The method is based on the observation that we can easily see the branches, leaves and their arrangement in a botanical tree, despite of the large number of elements. The strand model of Holton is used to convert an abstract tree into a geometric model. Non-leaf nodes are mapped to branches and child nodes to sub-branches. A naive application of this model leads to unsatisfactory results, hence it is tailored to suit our purposes better. Continuing branches are emphasized, long branches are contracted, and sets of leaves are shown as fruit. The method is applied to the visualization of directory structures. The elements, directories and files, as well as their relations can easily be extracted, thereby showing that the use of methods from botanical modeling can be effective for information visualization.
acm857710	Ordered Treemap Layouts	acm580582	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization 2001 (INFOVIS'01) 	73	null	hierarchies, information visualization, ordered treemaps, treemaps, trees	2	P28685	10-22-2001	11	Treemaps, a space-filling method of visualizing large hierarchical data sets, are receiving increasing attention. Several algorithms have been proposed to create more useful displays by controlling the aspect ratios of the rectangles that make up a treemap. While these algorithms do improve visibility of small items in a single layout, they introduce instability over time in the display of dynamically changing data, and fail to preserve an ordering of the underlying data. This paper introduces the ordered treemap, which addresses these two shortcomings. The ordered treemap algorithm ensures that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials, we show that compared to other layout algorithms ordered treemaps are more stable while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A second test set uses stock market data.

Interactions with computers were re-encoded in terms of fidelity to the interactions with real environment and consequently in terms of fitness to cognitive and spatial abilities. A further step in this direction was the creation of three-dimensional (3D) displays which have amplified the fidelity of digital representations. However, there are no systematic results evaluating the extent to which 3D displays better support cognitive spatial abilities. The aim of this research is to empirically investigate spatial memory performance across different instances of 2D and 3D displays. Two experiments were performed. The displays used in the experimental situation represented hierarchical information structures. The results of the test show that the 3D display does improve performances in the designed spatial memory task.

The visualizations are evaluated in the context of decision tree analyses prevalent in data mining applications. The results suggest that either the tree ring or icicle plot is equivalent to the organization chart.

The systems use different paradigms for visualizing data. Tasks were selected to be "ecologically relevant", i.e. meaningful and interesting in the respective domains. Users of one system turned out to solve problems significantly faster than users of the other two, while users of another system would supply significantly more correct answers. Reasons for these results and general observations about the studied systems are discussed.

Our system not only shows site topology and traffic flow, but by segmenting site traffic data based on user attributes, including demographic data and purchase history, we can present a more complete picture of web site usage. This can lead to a more focussed analysis that allows direct comparison between user segments, and ultimately a deeper understanding of how users interact with a site. The tool is designed for real world use, and we present a usage study of the tool by analyzing the data of a failed "dot-com".

Decision trees partition large amounts of data into smaller segments by applying a series of rules. Creating and evaluating decision trees benefits greatly from visualization of the trees and diagnostic measures of their effectiveness. This paper describes an application, EMTree Results Viewer, that supports decision tree analysis through the visualization of model results and diagnosis. The functionality of the application and the visualization techniques are revealed through an example of churn analysis in the telecommunications industry.

Unfortunately, this process can generate a huge amount of data that is difficult to interpret manually. We have created a system, Tarantula, that visually encodes test data to help find program errors. The system uses a principled color mapping to represent source lines in passed and failed tests. It also provides a flexible user interface for examining different perspectives that show the behavior of the source code on test sets, ranging from individual tests, to important subsets such as the set of failed tests, to the entire test suite.

Different to classical bar charts and line graphs, the spiral is suited to visualize large data sets and supports much better the identification of periodic structures in the data. Moreover, it supports both the visualization of nominal and quantitative data based on a similar visualization metaphor. The extension of the spiral visualization to 3D gives access to concepts for zooming and focusing and linking in the data set. As such, spirals complement other visualization techniques for time series and specifically enhance the identication of periodic patterns.

Data from a yeast cell cycle experiment with 6000 genes and 18 experimental measurements per gene are used to test this algorithm under practical conditions. The process of assigning database objects to an X,Y coordinate, ordination, is shown to be stable with respect to random starting conditions, and with respect to minor perturbations in the starting similarity estimates. Careful analysis of the way clusters typically co-locate, versus the occasional large displacements under different starting conditions are shown to be useful in interpreting the data. This extra stability information is lost when only a single cluster is reported, which is currently the accepted practice. However, it is believed that the approaches presented here should become a standard part of best practices in analyzing computer clustering of large data collections.

If people use an information visualization system to compare document collection subsets partitioned by their time-stamps, change blindness makes it impossible for them to recognize even very major changes, let alone minor ones. We describe theories from cognitive science that account for the change blindness phenomenon, as well as solutions developed for two visual analysis tools, a dot plot (SPIRE Galaxies) and landscape (ThemeView(tm)) visualizations.

We utilize a well-known method from photography and cinematography (depth-of-field effect) for information visualization, which is to blur different parts of the depicted scene in dependence of their relevance. Independent of their spatial locations, objects of interest are depicted sharply in SDOF, whereas the context of the visualization is blurred. In this paper, we present a flexible model of SDOF which can be easily adopted to various types of applications. We discuss pros and cons of the new technique, give examples of application, and describe a fast prototype implementation of SDOF.

This method allows a user to visually compare multiple query result sets, explore various combinations among the query result sets, and identify the "best" matches for combinations of multiple independent queries. This approach might also help users explore methods for progressively improving queries by visually comparing the improvement in result sets.

In addition, these graphics may have a high degree of overlap which may occlude a significant portion of the data values (as in the case of the x-y plots). In this paper, we therefore propose a generalization of traditional bar charts and x-y-plots which allows the visualization of large amounts of data. The basic idea is to use the pixels within the bars to present the detailed information of the data records. Our so-called pixel bar charts retain the intuitiveness of traditional bar charts while allowing very large data sets to be visualized in an effective way. We show that, for an effective pixel placement, we have to solve complex optimization problems, and present an algorithm which efficiently solves the problem. Our application using real-world e-commerce data shows the wide applicability and usefulness of our new idea.

Virtual instruments are enhanced using history encoding instruments are capable of displaying the current value and the value from the near past. Multi-instruments are capable of displaying several data sources simultaneously. Levels of detail for virtual instruments are introduced where the screen area is inversely proportional to the informationamount displayed. Furthermore the monitoring system is enhanced by using: 3D anchoring, attachment of instruments to positions on a 3D model, collision avoidance, a physically based spring model prevents instruments from overlapping, and focus+context rendering giving the user a possibility to examine particular instruments in detail without loosing the context information.

Interacting with such a dataset allows the biologist to identify distinct hypotheses about how different species or organisms evolved, which would not have been clear from traditional analyses. Our system integrates a point-set visualization of the distribution of hypothetical trees with detail views of an individual tree, or of a consensus tree summarizinga subset of trees. Efficient algorithms were required for the key tasks of computing distances between trees, finding consensus trees, and laying out the point-set visualization.

This article describes new interactive techniques capable of handling a million items (effectively visible and manageable on screen). We evaluate the use of hardware-based techniques available with newer graphics cards, as well as new animation techniques and non-standard graphical features such as stereovision and overlap count. These techniques have been applied to two popular information visualizations: treemaps and scatter plot diagrams; but are generic enough to be applied to other 2D representations as well.

As part of the effort on developing a general-purpose example-based generation system, we are building a visual database of graphic examples. In this paper, we address two main issues involved in constructing such a database: example selection and example modeling. As a result, our work offers three unique contributions: First, we build a visual database that contains a diverse collection of well-designed examples. Second, we develop a feature-based scheme to model all examples uniformly and accurately. Third, our visual database brings several important implications to the area of information visualization.
acm857736	Multiscale Visualization Using Data Cubes "InfoVis 2002 Best Paper"	acm857191	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'02) 	7	null	Multiscale visualization, database visualization, graphic formalism	3	P337868	10-28-2002	21	Most analysts start with an overview of the data before gradually refining their view to be more focused and detailed. Multiscale pan-and-zoom systems are effective because they directly support this approach. However, generating abstract overviews of large data sets is difficult, and most systems take advantage of only one type of abstraction: visual abstraction. Furthermore, these existing systems limit the analyst to a single zooming path on their data andthus a single set of abstract views.This paper presents: (1) a formalism for describing multiscale visualizations of data cubes with both data and visual abstraction, and (2) a method for independently zooming along one or more dimensions by traversing a zoom graph with nodes at different levels of detail. As an example of how to design multiscale visualizations using our system, we describe four design patterns using our formalism. These design patterns show the effectiveness of multiscalevisualization of general relational databases.

This flexibility is enabled by the concept of relational data schemas, which allow data owners to easily design custom databases according to their unique needs. However, user interfaces and information visualizations for accessing and utilizing databases have not kept pace with this level of flexibility. This paper introduces the concept of Visualization Schemas, based on the Snap-Together Visualization model, which are analogous to relational data schemas. Visualization schemas enable users to rapidly construct customized multiple-view visualizations for databases in a similarly flexible fashion without programming. Since the design of appropriate visualizations for a given database depends on the data schema, visualization schemas are a natural analogy to the data schema concept.

This paper is inspired by a number of such contemporary techniques and presents a novel hybrid approach based upon stochastic sampling, interpolation and spring models. We use Chalmers' 1996 0(N2) spring model as a benchmark when evaluating our technique, comparing layout quality and run times using data sets of synthetic and real data. Our algorithm runs in 0(N\sqrt N) and executes significantly faster than CHalmers' 1996 algorithm, whilst producing superior layouts. In reducing complexity and run time, we allow the visualisation of data sets of previously infeasible size. Our results indicate that our method is a solid foundation for interactive and visual exploration of data.

ACE exhibits improvement of something like two orders of magnitude over the fastest algorithms we are aware of; it draws graphs of millions of nodes in less than a minute. ACE finds optimal drawing by minimizing a quadratic energy function. The minimization problem is expressed as a generalized eigenvalue problem, which is rapidly solved using novel algebraic multigrid technique. The samegeneralized eigenvalue problem seems to come up also in other fields, hence ACE appears to be applicable outside of graph drawing too.

In addition to the intermediate states of the network it conveys the nature of the change between them by unrolling the dynamics of the network. Each modification is shown in a separate layer of a three-dimensional representation, where the stack of layers corresponds to a time line of the evolution. We focus on discourse networks as the driving application, but our method extends to any type of network evolving in similar ways.
acm857741	Multiple Foci Drill-Down through Tuple and Attribute Aggregation Polyarchies in Tabular Data	acm857191	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'02) 	131	null	null	3	P345055	10-28-2002	14	Information analysis often involves decomposing data into sub-groups to allow for comparison and identification of relationships. Breakdown Visualization provides a mechanism to support this analysis through user guided drill-down of polyarchical metadata. This metadata describes multiple hierarchical structures for organizing tuple aggregations and table attributes. Thisstructure is seen in financial data, organizational structures, sport statistics, and other domains. A spreadsheet format enables comparison of visualizations at any level of the hierarchy. Breakdown Visualization allows users to drill-down a single hierarchy then pivot into another hierarchy within the same view. It utilizes a fix and move technique that allows users to select multiple foci for drill-down.

We also demonstrate smooth brushing as an intuitive tool for specifying non-binary degree-of-interest functions (for focus+context visualization). We also briefly describe our implementation as well as its application to the visualization of CFD data.

We decomposed the general path analysis problem into a set of distinct subproblems, and createda visual metaphor for analyzing each of them. Our system works off of multiple representations of the clickstream, and exposes the path extraction algorithms and data to the visual metaphors as web services. We have combined the visual metaphors into a web-based "path analysis portal" that lets the user easily switch between the different modes of analysis.

Now more than ever it becomes really important for venture capitalists (VCs) to monitor the state of the startups market and continually update their investment strategy to suit the rapidly changing market conditions. This paper presents three new visualization metaphors (Spiral Map, TimeTicker, and Double Histogram) for monitoring the startups market. While we are focusing on the VC domain, the visual metaphors developed are general and can be easily applied to other domains.

It can be used especially for the display of very large hierarchies in a 2-dimensional space. We discuss the advantages and limitations of current techniques of tree visualization. Our strategy is to optimize the drawing of trees in a geometrical plane and maximize the utilization of displayspace by allowing more nodes and links to be displayed at a limit screen resolution. We use the concept of enclosure to partition the entire display space into a collection of local regions that are assigned to all nodes in tree T for the display of their sub-trees and themselves. To enable the exploration of large hierarchies, we use a modified semantic zooming technique to view the detail of a particular part of the hierarchy at a time based on user's interest. Layout animation is also provided to preserve the mental map while the user is exploring the hierarchy by changing zoomed views.

Several RSF systems and tools have been developed to date, each with varying degrees of support for interactive operations such as selection and navigation. In this paper, we describe what we believe to be a complete set ofdesirable operations on hierarchical structures. We then present InterRing, an RSF hierarchy visualization system that supports a significantly more extensive set of these operations than prior systems. In particular, InterRing supports multi-focus distortions, interactive hierarchy reconfiguration, and both semi-automated and manual selection. We show the power and utility of these and other operations, and describe our on-going efforts to evaluate their effectiveness and usability.

Nodes are shown as stacked circular beams, such that both the hierarchical structure as well as the size of nodes are depicted. The dimensions of beams are calculated using a variation of the treemap algorithm. A small user study indicated that beamtrees are significantly more effective than nested treemaps and cushion treemaps for the extraction of global hierarchical information.

By graphical encoding we mean the use of visual display elements such as icon color, shape, size, or position to convey information about objects represented by the icons. Literature offers inconclusive and often conflicting viewpoints, including the suggestion that the effectiveness of a graphical encodingdepends on the type of data represented. Our empirical study suggests that the nature of the users' perceptual task is more indicative of the effectiveness of a graphical encoding than the type of data represented.

It adds dynamic rescaling of branches of the tree to best fit the available screen space, optimized camera movement, and the use of preview icons summarizing the topology of the branches that cannot be expanded. In addition, it includes integrated search and filter functions. This paper reflects on the evolution of the design and highlights the principles that emerged from it. A controlled experiment showed benefits for navigation to already previouslyvisited nodes and estimation of overall tree topology.
acm857753	The Illusion of Perceived Metric 3D Structure	acm857191	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'02) 	51	null	Visualization, affine structure, metric structure, 3D, virtual reality	3	P194288	10-28-2002	12	A large body of results on the characteristics of human spatial vision suggests that space perception is distorted. Recent studies indicate that the geometry of visual space is best understood as Affine. If this is the case, it has far reaching implications on how 3D visualizations can be successfully employed. For instance, all attempts to build visualization systems where users are expected to discover relations based on Euclidean distances or shapes will be ineffective. Because visualization can, and sometimes do, employ all possible types of depth information and because the results from vision research usually concentrates on one or two such types, three experiments were performed under near optimal viewing conditions. The aim of the experiments was twofold: To test whether the earlier findings generalize to optimal viewing conditions and to get a sense of the size of the error under such conditions. The results show that the findings do generalize and that the errors are large. The implications of these results for successful visualizations are discussed.
acm857754	Visualizing Data with Bounded Uncertainty	acm857191	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'02) 	37	null	bounded uncertainty, uncertainty visualization	2	P46262	10-28-2002	17	Visualization is a powerful way to facilitate data analysis, but it is crucial that visualization systems explicitly convey the presence, nature, and degree of uncertainty to users. Otherwise, there is a danger that data will be falsely interpreted, potentially leading to inaccurate conclusions. A common method for denoting uncertainty is to use error bars or similar techniques designed to convey the degree of statistical uncertainty. While uncertainty can often be modeled statistically, a second form of uncertainty, bounded uncertainty, can also arise that has very different properties than statistical uncertainty. Error bars should not be used for bounded uncertainty because they do not convey the correct properties, so a different technique should be used instead. In this paper we describe a technique for conveying bounded uncertainty in visualizations and show how it can be applied systematically to common displays of abstract charts and graphs. Interestingly, it is not always possible to show the exact degree of uncertainty, and in some cases it can only be displayed approximately.
acm857755	Efficient Cartogram Generation: A Comparison	acm857191	Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'02) 	33	null	null	4	P58960	10-28-2002	8	Cartograms are a well-known technique for showing geography-related statistical information, such as population demographics and epidemiological data. The basic idea is to distort a map by resizing its regions according to a statistical parameter, but in a way that keeps the maprecognizable. In this paper, we deal with the problem of making continuous cartograms that strictly retain the topology of the input mesh. We compare two algorithms to solve the continuous cartogram problem. The first one uses an iterative relocation of the vertices based on scanlines. The second one is based on the Gridfit technique, which uses pixel-based distortion based on a quadtree-like data structure.

When designing a graphic, BOZ aims to optimize two ways in which graphics help expedite human performance of information-processing tasks: (1) allowing users to substitute simple perceptual inferences in place of more demanding logical inferences, and (2) streamlining users' search for needed information. BOZ analyzes a logical description of a task to be performed by a human user and designs a provably equivalent perceptual task by substituting perceptual inferences in place of logical inferences in the task description. BOZ then designs and renders an accompanying graphic that encodes and structures data such that performance of each perceptual inference is supported and visual search is minimized. BOZ produces a graphic along with a perceptual procedure describing how to use the graphic to complete the task. A key feature of BOZ's approach is that it is able to design different presentations of the same information customized to the requirements of different tasks. BOZ is used to design graphic presentations of airline schedule information to support five different airline reservation tasks. Reaction time studies done with real users for one task and graphic show that the BOZ-designed graphic significantly reduces users' performance time to the task. Regression analyses link the observed efficiency savings to BOZ's two key design principles: perceptual inference substitutions and pruning of visual search.

The main principle behind the language is that it is possible to display and query the database with arbitrary pictures . We allow the user to tailor the display of the data to suit the application at hand or her preferences. We want the user-defined visualizations to be stored in the database, and the language to express all kinds of visual manipulations. For extendibility reasons, the language is object-oriented. The semantics of the language is given by a well-known deductive query language for object-oriented databases. We hope that the formal basis of our language will contribute to the theoretical study of database visualizations and visual query languages, a subject that we believe is of great interest, but largely left unexplored.

In this system, articles in a bibliography are represented by particles in 3-space. By using physically-based modelling techniques to take advantage of fast methods for the approximation of potential fields, we represent the relationships between articles by their relative spatial positions. Inter-particle forces tend to make similar articles move closer to one another and dissimilar ones move apart. The result is a 3D scene which can be used to visualize patterns in the high-D information space.

User testing was done with eighteen undergraduate students who performed significantly faster using a dynamic queries interface compared to both a natural language system and paper printouts. The interfaces were used to explore a real-estate database and find homes meeting specific search criteria.

In the Retrieval Experiment-Virginia Tech OnLine Catalog (REVTOLC) study we carried out a large pilot test in 1987 and a larger, controlled investigation in 1990, with 216 users and roughly 500,000 MARC records. Results indicated that a forms-based interface coupled with vector and relevance feedback retrieval methods would be well received. Recent efforts developing the Multiple Access and Retrieval of Information with Annotations (MARIAN) system have involved used of a specially developed object-oriented DBMS, construction of a client running under NeXTSTEP, programming of a distributed server with a thread assigned to each user session to increase concurrency on a small network of NeXTs, refinement of algorithms to use objects and stopping rules for greater efficiency, usability testing and iterative interface refinement.

A hierarchic marking menu uses hierarchic radial menus and "zig-zag" marks to select from the hierarchy. This paper experimentally investigates the bounds on how many items can be in each level, and how deep the hierarchy can be, before using a marking to select an item becomes too slow or prone to errors.

Increasing interest in recent years has been focused on the development of distortion-oriented presentation techniques to address this problem. However, the growing number of new terminologies and techniques developed have caused considerable confusion to the graphical user interface designer, consequently making the comparison of these presentation techniques and generalization of empirical results of experiments with them very difficult, if not impossible. This article provides a taxonomy of distortion-oriented techniques which demonstrates clearly their underlying relationships. A unified theory is presented to reveal their roots and origins. Issues relating to the implementation and performance of these techniques are also discussed.

For example, in concurrent application, events would represent state changes for some system object (such as a task or variable). A timeline display generator creates the graphical visualization from some record of events. This paper reports on a model for timeline display generators based on a formal model of event history and the objectives of timeline visualization. In this model, any timeline display generator is completely described through the definition of a set of mathematical functions. The exact characteristics and flexibility of a particular implementation of a timeline display generator, depends on the way in which these functions have been implemented. The current prototype, xtg, (Timeline Display Generator for X-windows) serves as an example implementation of these ideas. Characteristics of xtg are presented, and its use in the analysis of a real-world client-server application is discussed. Xtg has been applied to several other applications to-date and is being applied by several telecommunications companies to areas ranging from software process analysis to call trace data analysis.

Compared to conventional numerical spreadsheets, spreadsheets for images pose several unique design problems: larger formulas, longer computation times, and more complicated intercelldependencies. In response to these problems, we have extended the spreadsheet paradigm in three ways: formulas can display their results anywhere in the spreadsheet, cells can be selectively disabled, and multiple cells can be edited at once. We discuss these extensions and their implications, and we also point out some unexpected uses for our spreadsheets: as a visual database browser, as a graphical user interface builder, as a smart clipboard for the desktop, and as a presentation tool.

The effect of factors like size, distribution and dimensionality of data on the storage overhead and the speed of search is explored. Analytical models for estimating the storage and the search overheads are presented, and verified to be correct by empirical data. Results indicate that multilists are suitable for small (few thousand points) data sets irrespective of the data distribution. For large data sets the grid files are excellent for uniformly distributed data, and trees are good for skewed data distributions. There was no significant difference in performance between the tree structures.

At the heart of this system is a powerful relationship construction engine that constructs an associative relation network to automatically build implicit links between related articles. To visualize these relationships, and hence the news information space, the Galaxy of News uses pyramidal structuring and visual presentation, semantic zooming and panning, animated visual cues that are dynamically constructed to illustrate relationships between articles, and fluid interaction in a three dimensional information space to browse and search through large databases of news articles. The result is a tool that allows people to quickly gain a broad understanding of a news base by providing an abstracted presentation that covers the entire information base, and through interaction, progressively refines the details of the information space. This research has been generalized into a model for news access and visualization to provide automatic construction of news information spaces and derivation of an interactive news experience.

The essence of our approach is to lay out the hierarchy uniformly on the hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a circular display region. The projection onto the disk provides a natural mechanism for assigning more space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in a much larger context. Change of focus is accomplished by translating the structure on the hyperbolic plane, which allows a smooth transition without compromising the presentation of the context.

The traditional solution is zoom and pan . But each time a zoom-in operation takes place, the context from which it came is visually lost. Sequential applications of the zoom-in and zoom-out operations may become tedious. This paper proposes an alternative technique, the macroscope , based on zooming and planning in multiple translucent layers. A macroscope display should comfortably permit browsing continuously on a single image, or set of images in multiple resolutions, on a scale of at least 1 to 10,000.

Clearly such tasks can never be automated fully, but few existing tools offer support for mechanising more than the simplest repetitive aspects of the search. Reconnaissance facilities, in which the computer produces summary reports from exploration in directions suggested by the user, can save the user time and effort by revealing which areas are the most deserving of detailed investigation. The time users are prepared to spend on searching will be more effectively used, improving the likelihood of finding solutions that really meet their needs rather than merely being the first to appear satisfactory. This note describes an implemented example of reconnaissance, based on the parallel coordinates presentation technique.

The toolkit provides methods for the direct manipulation of 3D primitives which can be linked together through a visual programming language to create complex constrained behavior. Features of the toolkit include the ability to visually build, encapsulate, and parameterize complex models, and impose limits on the models. The toolkit's constraint resolution technique is based on a dynamic object model similar to those in prototype delegation object systems. The toolkit has been used to rapidly prototype tools for mechanical modelling, scientific visualization, construct 3D widgets, and build mathematical illustrations.

Both rapid interactive exploration of datasets and precise control over the parameters and placement of visualization techniques are required to understand complex phenomena contained in these datasets. In this paper, we present work in progress on a 3D user interface for exploratory visualization of these datasets.

Time-based information, in particular, is an important part of many information access tasks. This paper explores how to use 3D graphics and interactive animation to design and implement visualizers that improve access to large masses of time-based information. Two new visualizers have been developed for the Information Visualizer: 1) the Spiral Calendar was designed for rapid access to an individual's daily schedule, and 2) the Time Lattice was designed for analyzing the time relationships among the schedules of groups of people. The Spiral Calendar embodies a new 3D graphics technique for integrating detail and context by placing objects in a 3D spiral. It demonstrates that advanced graphics techniques can enhance routine office information tasks. The Time Lattice is formed by aligning a collection of 2D calendars. 2D translucent shadows provide views and interactive access to the resulting complex 3D object. The paper focuses on how these visualizations were developed. The Spiral Calendar, in particular, has gone through an entire cycle of development, including design, implementation, evaluation, revision and reuse. Our experience should prove useful to others developing user interfaces based on advanced graphics.

Users seek and retrieve information from the sources-for example, file serves, databases, and digital libraries-and use various tools to browse, manipulate, reuse, and generally process the information. We have developed a number of techniques that support various aspects of the process of user/information interaction. These techniques can be considered attempts to increase the bandwidth and quality of the interactions between users and information in an information workspace -an environment designed to support information work (see Figure 1).

Point-feature label placement (PFLP) is the problem of placing text labels adjacent to point features on a map or diagram so as to maximize legibility. This problem occurs frequently in the production of many types of informational graphics, though it arises most often in automated cartography. In this paper we present a comprehensive treatment of the PFLP problem, viewed as a type of combinatorial optimization problem. Complexity analysis reveals that the basic PFLP problem and most interesting variants of it are NP-hard. These negative results help inform a survey of previously reported algorithms for PFLP; not surprisingly, all such algorithms either have exponential time complexity or are incomplete. To solve the PFLP problem in practice, then, we must rely on good heuristic methods. We propose two new methods, one based on a discrete form of gradient descent, the other on simulated annealing, and report on a series of empirical tests comparing these and the other known algorithms for the problem. Based on this study, the first to be conducted, we identify the best approaches as a function of available computation time.

Many problems in distributed systems can be cast in terms of the problem of detecting global states. For instance, the global state detection algorithm helps to solve an important class of problems: stable property detection. A stable property is one that persists: once a stable property becomes true it remains true thereafter. Examples of stable properties are "computation has terminated," " the system is deadlocked" and "all tokens in a token ring have disappeared." The stable property detection problem is that of devising algorithms to detect a given stable property. Global state detection can also be used for checkpointing.

These techniques allow viewers to perform simple data analysis tasks such as detection of data groups and boundaries, target detection, and estimation. The goal is to do this rapidly and accurately on a dynamic sequence of data frames. Our techniques take advantage of an ability of the human visual system called preattentive processing. Preattentive processing refers to an initial organization of the visual system based on operations believed to be rapid, automatic, and spatially parallel. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, orientation, intensity, size, curvature, and line length. We believe that studies from preattentive processing should be used to assist in the design of visualization tools, especially those for which high speed target, boundary, and region detection are important. Previous work has shown that results from research in preattentive processing can be used to build visualization tools that allow rapid and accurate analysis of individual, static data frames. We extend these techniques to a dynamic real-time environment. This allows users to perform similar tasks on dynamic sequences of frames, exactly like those generated by real-time systems such as visual interactive simulation. We studied two known preattentive features, hue and curvature. The primary question investigated was whether rapid and accurate target and boundary detection in dynamic sequences is possible using these features. Behavioral experiments were run that simulated displays from our preattentive visualization tools. Analysis of the results of the experiments showed that rapid and accurate target and boundary detection is possible with both hue and curvature. A second question, whether interactions occur between the two features in a real-time environment, was answered positively.

This suggests that such views ("fisheye views") might be useful for the computer display of large information structures like programs, data bases, online text, etc. This paper explores fisheye views presenting, in turn, naturalistic studies, a general formalism, a specific instantiation, a resulting computer program, example displays and an evaluation.

We describe a fast algorithm to map objects into points in some k-dimensional space (k is user-defined), such that the dis-similarit ies are preserved. There are two benefits from this mapping: (a) efficient ret rieval, in conjunction with a SAM, as discussed before and (b) visualization and data-mining: the objects can now be plotted as points in 2-d or 3-d space, revealing pot ential clusters, correlations among attributes and other regularities that data-mining is looklng for. We introduce an older method from pattern recognition, namely, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) [51]; although unsuitable for indexing, we use it as yardstick for our method. Then, we propose a much faster algorithm to solve the problem in hand, while in addition it allows for indexing. Experiments on real and synthetic data indeed show that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than MDS, (being linear, as opposed to quadratic, on the database size N), while it manages to preserve distances and the overall structure of the data-set.

Two problems are raised by this goal: The codification of graphic design criteria in a form that can be used by the presentation tool, and the generation of a wide variety of designs so that the presentation tool can accommodate a wide variety of information. The approach described in this paper is based on the view that graphical presentations are sentences of graphical languages. The graphic design issues are codified as expressiveness and effectiveness criteria for graphical languages. Expressiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language can express the desired information. Effectiveness criteria determine whether a graphical language exploits the capabilities of the output medium and the human visual system. A wide variety of designs can be systematically generated by using a composition algebra that composes a small set of primitive graphical languages. Artificial intelligence techniques are used to implement a prototype presentation tool called APT (A Presentation Tool), which is based on the composition algebra and the graphic design criteria.

The method is derived from an area of human cognitive psychology called preattentive processing. Preattentive processing refers to an initial organization of the visual field based on cognitive operations believed to be rapid, automatic, and spatially parallel. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, intensity, orientation, size, and motion. We beleive that studies from preattentive vision should be used to assist in the design of visualization tools, especially those for which high-speed target detection, boundary identification, and region detection are important. In our present study, we investigated two known preattentive features (hue and orientation) in the context of a new task (numerical estimation) in order to see whether preattentive estimation was possible. Our experiments tested displays that were designed to visualize data from salmon migration simulations. The results showed that rapid and accurate estimation was indeed possible using either hue or orientation. Furthermore, random variation in one of these features resulted in no interference when subjects estimated the percentage of the other. To test the generality of our results, we varied two important display parameters-display duration and feature difference-and found boundary conditions for each. Implications of our results for application to real-world data and tasks are discussed.

Subjects using both viewing methods were given problem-solving tasks requiring them to navigate a network, in this case, a simulated telephone system, and to reroute links in it. Results suggest that the greater context provided by fisheye views significantly improved user performance. Users were quicker to complete their task and made fewer unnecessary navigational steps through the hierarchy. This validation of fisheye views in important for designers of interfaces to complicated monitoring systems, such as control rooms for supervisory control and data acquistion systems, where efficient human performance is often critical. However, control room operators remained concerned about the size and visibility tradeoffs between the fine room operators remained concerned about the size and visibility tradeoffs between the fine detail provided by full-zoom techniques and the global context supplied by fisheye views. Specific interface feaures are required to reconcile the differences.

Our algorithm deals with general undirected graphs with straight-line edges, and employs several simple criteria for the aesthetic quality of the result. The algorithm is flexible, in that the relative weights of the criteria can be changed. For graphs of modest size it produces good results, competitive with those produced by other methods, notably, the "spring method" and its variants.

While DEVise is a powerful visualization tool, its greatest strengths are the ability to interactively explore a visual presentation of the data at any level of detail (including retrieving individual data records), and the ability to seamlessly query and combine data from a variety of local and remote sources. In this paper, we present the DEVise framework, describe the current tool, and report on our experience in applying it to several real applications.

In this hybrid approach, source code contains two programs: the normal C++ run-time program, and a template metaprogram which runs at compile time. Template metaprograms can generate useful code when interpreted by the compiler, such as a massively inlined algorithm -- that is, an implementation of an algorithm which works for a specific input size, and has its loops unrolled. This results in large speed increases for many applications.

This article deals with rendering graphs to show proximity between vertices by making their configuration (screen) distances reflect their distances in the graph. An arrangement method is described that achieves good drawings at speeds suitable for user interaction on a desktop computer. The method is "incremental" in that it first arranges a small portion of the graph, then arranges successively larger fractions of the graph until a suitable arrangement for the entirety is achieved. The incremental approach not only offers speed improvements, but avoids many of the suboptimal solutions reached with other iterative approaches. Algorithms are described in pseudocode, and results are presented.

Those visualizations, however, fail to present the dynamically changing ecology of users and documents on the Web. We present new techniques for Web Ecology and Evolution Visualization (WEEV). Disk Trees represent a discrete time slice of the Web ecology. A collection of Disk Trees form a Time Tube, representing the evolution of the Web over longer periods of time. These visualizations are intended to aid authors and webmasters with the production and organization of content, assist Web surfers making sense of information, and help researchers understand the Web.

First, multiple users with different backgrounds have individual information needs and thus require multiple views on the information. Second, to allow users to experiment with the information and the visualization, the visualization must be adaptable. This paper presents a conceptual framework which decouples the generation and presentation of information by means of an intermediate derived model, allowing users to adapt the visualization to their information needs. Additionall, we will discuss a Web-based software architecture which deploys CORBA to allow for dynamic and interactive visualizations

This approach uses n-grams and latent semantic indexing (LSI) to cluster documents according to usage patterns of related n-gram "terms". Latent semantic indexing distributes documents and terms into a relatively low=dimensional space, which can be viewed grpahically using various visualization techniques.

The cityscape metaphor is a generalization of barcharts in 3D. Our approach serves for better exploitation of human perception capabilities. To achieve this we employ effective visual cues like node position and size. We determine node positions in terms of perceptual organization. Further, we determine node sites for providing redundant hierarchical information. Redundancy aides in better understanding the tree structure. Finally, we point out some of the advantages of this approach to other spatial metaphors such as cone trees.

This paper introduces a specification technique for direct-manipulation interfaces based on these observations. In it, each locus of dialogue is described as a separate object with a single-thread state diagram, which can be suspended and resumed, but retains state. The objects are then combined to define the overall user interface as a set of coroutines, rather than inappropriately as a single highly regular state transition diagram. An inheritance mechanism for the interaction objects is provided to avoid repetitiveness in the specifications. A prototype implementation of a user-interface management system based on this approach is described, and example specifications are given.

DataSplash is an easy-to-use, integrated environment for navigating, creating, and querying visual representations of data. We will demonstrate the three main components which make up the DataSplash environment: a navigation system, a direct-manipulation interface for creating and modifying visualizations, and a direct-manipulation visual query system.

In tasks requiring returns to prior pages, user of PadPrints completed tasks in 61.2% of the time required by users of the same browser without PadPrints. We also observed significant decreases in the number of pages acessed when using PadPrints. User found browsing with PadPrints more satisfying than using Netscape alone.

Further, applying a classical geometric lemma on random projections (for which we give a simpler proof, we obtain the first known algorithm with polynomial preprocessing and query time polynomial in d and log n. Unfortunately, for small e, the latter is purely theoretical result since the exponent depends on 1/e. Experimental results indicate that our first algorithm offers orders of magnitude improvement on running time over real data sets. Its key ingredient is the notion of locality-sensitive heashing which may be of independent interest; here, we give applications to information retrieval, pattern recognition, dynamic closest-pairs, and fast-clustering algorithms.

The underlying technology, called TOPIC-O-GRAPHY, applies wavelet transforms to a custom digital signal constructed from words within a document. The resultant multiresolution wavelet energy is used to analyze the characteristics of the narrative flow in the frequency domain, such as theme changes, which is then related to overall thematic characteristics of a document using statistical methods. The thematic characteristics of a document can be analyzed at varying degrees of detail, ranging from section-sized text partitions to partitions consisting of a few words. Using this technology, we are developing a visualization system prototype known as TOPIC ISLANDS to browse a document, generate fuzzy document outlines, summarize text by levels of detail and according to user interests, define meaningful subdocuments, query text content, and provide summaries of topic evolution.

A continuous area cartogram is a cartogram that is constructed without changing the underlying map topology. We present a new algorithm for the construction of continuous area cartograms as a constrained optimization problem. The algorithm uses a relaxation method that exploits hierarchical resolution, constrained dynamics, and a scheme that alternates goals of achieving correct region areas and adjusting region shapes. It is compared favorably to existing methods in its ability to preserve region shape recognition cues, while still achieving high accuracy.
acm288306	Interactive display of very large textures	acm288216	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the conference on Visualization '98	343	350	bandwidth-limited resource, interactivity, real-time display, texture caching, texture mapping	2	P61019	1998	13	Large textures cause bottlenecks in real-time applications that often lead to a loss of interactivity. These performance bottlenecks occur because disk and network transfer, texture translation, and memory swapping. We present a software solution that alleviates the problems associated with large textures by treating texture as a bandwidth-limited resource rather than a finite resource. As a result the display of large textures is reduced to a caching problem in which texture memory serves as the primary cache for texture data, main memory as the secondary cache, and local disk the tertiary cache. By using this cache hierarchy, applications are able to maintain real-time performance while displaying textures hundreds of times larger than can fit into texture memory.

We present a set of view-based navigational aids that allow navigators to find their way through desert fog in multiscale electronic worlds. Prototypes of these aids have been implemented in the Landmarking and ZTracker systems. We introduce the concept of critical zone analysis, a method of grouping objects according to their visibility in views of the information world rather than their spatial layout. This concept was derived from a formal analysis of desert fog using view-navigation theory. Our analysis informally extends view-navigation theory to accommodate spatial multiscale worlds and is detailed in the paper.

We need, not only better environments for dealing with this vast scale, but better tools for authoring information in those environments. This paper describes a new type of tool for authoring objects in infinite pan/zoom (so-called ÒmultiscaleÓ) environments, like PAD++. Called the MultiScale Editor (MuSE) it provides a direct way to manipulate objects in scale, simplifying important operations for authoring with large, multiscale information worlds.

One common approach involves using 2D spatial layouts of icons representing the documents, particularly for information workspace tasks. This approach takes advantage of human 2D spatial cognition. More recently, several 3D spatial layouts have engaged 3D spatial cognition capabilities. Some have attempted to use spatial memory in 3D virtual environments. However, there has been no proof to date that spatial memory works the same way in 3D virtual environments as it does in the real world. We describe a new technique for document management called the Data Mountain, which allows users to place documents at arbitrary positions on an inclined plane in a 3D desktop virtual environment using a simple 2D interaction technique. We discuss how the design evolved in response to user feedback. We also describe a user study that shows that the Data Mountain does take advantage of spatial memory. Our study shows that the Data Mountain has statistically reliable advantages over the Microsoft Internet Explorer Favorites mechanism for managing documents of interest in an information workspace.

A user- centred, task-oriented, comparative evaluation of Epic was undertaken in which two versions of the system--one set up to enable spatial queries only, the other allowing textual queries only--were compared. Use was made of the two systems by design professionals in simulated work task situations, and quantitative and qualitative data collected as indicators of the levels of usersÕ satisfaction. Results demonstrated that users often had a Ômental imageÕ of a potentially satisfying picture in mind, that they were happy to express this need in visual terms, and that in doing so they preferred to have access to EpicÕs spatial-querying facility. Success in obtaining statistically significant results appears to support validation of the novel methodological framework adopted.

We consider both of these stages in the context of the TREC experiments, to determine whether they lead to measurements that are trustworthy and fair. Our detailed empirical investigation of the TREC results shows that the measured relative performance of systems appears to be reliable, but that recall is overestimated: it is likely that many relevant documents have not been found. We propose a new pooling strategy that can significantly increase the number of relevant documents found for given effort, without compromising fairness.

The central idea is the use of a set ofpattems obtained from the underlying database through an one-time computation. These patterns are subsequently searched for on every query sequence presented to the system. A pattern matched by a region of the query pinpoints to a potential local similarity between that region and all the database sequences also matching that pattern. By using a set of prudently chosen patterns, the tool presented in this work is able to discover weak but biologically important similarities.

The scope for visualisation of Gopher and WWW spaces is restricted by the limitations of their respective data models. The far richer data model supported by the Hyper-G Internet information system is exploited by its Harmony client to provide a number of tightly-coupled, two- and three-dimensional visualisation and navigational facilities, which help provide location feedback and alleviate user disorientation.

Given such a presentation, the user wants to quickly view parts of the presentation in detail while remaining in context. A fisheye view or a magnifying lens might be used for this, but they fail to adequately show the global context. The Document Lens is a 3D visualization for large rectangular presentations that allows the user to quickly focus on a part of a presentation while continuously remaining in context. The user grabs a rectangular lens and pulls it around to focus on the desired area at the desired magnification. The presentation outside the lens is stretched to provide a continuous display of the global context. This stretching is efficiently implemented with affine transformations, allowing text documents to be viewed as a whole with an interactive visualization.

It supports a lightweight form of exploratory data analysis (EDA) by integrating a familiar organization, the table, with graphical representations and a small set of direct manipulation operators. We examine the EDA process as a special case of a generic process, which we call sensemaking. Using a GOMS methodology, we characterize a few central EDA tasks and compare performance of the Table Lens and one of the best of the more traditional graphical tools for EDA i.e. Splus. This analysis reveals that Table Lens is more or less on par with the power of Splus, while requiring the use of fewer specialized graphical representations. It essentially combines the graphical power of Splus with the direct manipulation and generic properties of spreadsheets and relational database front ends. We also propose a number of design refinements that are suggested by our task characterizations and analyses.

An informal taxonomy of labeling methods is proposed. We then describe Òexcentric labelingÓ, a new dynamic technique to label a neighborhood of objects located around the cursor. This technique does not intrude into the existing interaction, it is not computationally intensive, and was easily applied to several visualization applications. A pilot study with eight subjects indicates a strong speed benefit over a zoom interface for tasks that involve the exploration of large numbers of objects. Observations and comments from users are presented.

This kind of model can be used as an interface between the user and the computer, for overview and control of applications, tile systems, networks and ofher computer resources, as well as for communication and collaboration with other users in the networked environment. We model proximity with a geometric volume of the immediate surroundings, [he aura, of the participantÕs representation in the synthetic environment. This proximity, or aura, is used to establish presence at meetings, to establish communication charnels and to provide interaction.

Although many people believe that algorithm animations are useful this way, no empirical evidence has ever been presented supporting this belief. We have conducted an empirical study of a priority queue algorithm animation, and the studyÕs results indicate that the animation only slightly assisted student understanding. In this article, we analyze those results and hypothesize why algorithm animations may not be as helpful as was initially hoped. We also develop guidelines for making algorithm animations more useful in the future.

Oddly, little research has been done on the processes underlying icon search. This paper outlines the factors involved in icon search and proposes a model of the process. An experiment was conducted which suggests that the proposed model is sound, and that the most important factor in searching for files is the type of icons used. In general, simple icons (those discriminable based on a few features) seem to help users, while complex icons are no better than simple rectangles.

The user is given the ability to alter the graph as the design progresses. Interactive Graph Drawing allows the user to dynamically interact with the drawing of a graph. In this paper, we discuss features that are essential for an interactive orthogonal graph drawing system. We also describe some possible interactive drawing scenarios, present results on two of them, and compare their performance.

These power-laws hold for three snapshots of the Internet, between November 1997 and December 1998, despite a 45% growth of its size during that period. We show that our power-laws fit the real data very well resulting in correlation coefficients of 96% or higher.Our observations provide a novel perspective of the structure of the Internet. The power-laws describe concisely skewed distributions of graph properties such as the node outdegree. In addition, these power-laws can be used to estimate important parameters such as the average neighborhood size, and facilitate the design and the performance analysis of protocols. Furthermore, we can use them to generate and select realistic topologies for simulation purposes.

This case study examines how one technique, the use of logging data, was used throughout the design of a new text editor which is measurably easy to learn and easy to use. Logging data was used in four areas: keyboard design, the initial design of the editor's command set, refinements made later in the design cycle, and the construction of a system performance benchmark.

Conventional multivariate visualization techniques generally do not scale well with respect to the size of the data set. The focus of this paper is on the interactive visualization of large multivariate data sets based on a number of novel extensions to the parallel coordinates display technique. We develop a multiresolutional view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and use a variation on parallel coordinates to convey aggregation information for the resulting clusters. Users can then navigate the resulting structure until the desired focus region and level of detail is reached, using our suite of navigational and filtering tools. We describe the design and implementation of our hierarchical parallel coordinates system which is based on extending the XmdvTool system. Lastly, we show examples of the tools and techniques applied to large (hundreds of thousands of records) multivariate data sets.

For a file of N records, each of k keys, the worst-case running times of our search algorithms are bounded above, respectively, by O(k + log N), O(t + 3k-Ò(s + log N)), O(t + (log N)k), and O(t + 3k-s(log N)Ò) where s is the number of keys specified in a partial match (or range) query and t is the number of records retrieved by the query. The fde structure can be built in O(N(log N)k/(k - l)!) time and requires similar storage; by a slight modification, both of these requirements can be reduced to O(N(log N)k-Ô/(k - l)!). We also sketch outlines for inserting and deleting records that require O(k + (log N)k) time, on the average. This structure achieves faster response time than previously known structures (for many of the queries) at the cost of extra storage.

Through a novel combination of text reduction and focus+context visualization, users can access web pages from a very limited display environment, since the system will provide an overview of the contents of a web page even when it is too large to be displayed in its entirety. To make maximum use of the limited resources available on a typical hand-held terminal, much of the most demanding work is done by a proxy server, allowing the terminal to concentrate on the task of providing responsive user interaction. The system makes use of some interaction concepts reminiscent of those defined in the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), making it possible to utilize the techniques described here for WAP-compliant devices and services that may become available in the near future.

In this article, we describe two uncustomary approaches: a project in large-scale graphics and network displays, and an experiment with a novel graphical representation of networks.

The data could be a sequence of characters or sets of characters or even real values. In the first two cases, the number of motifs could potentially be exponential in the size of the input sequence and in the third case there could be infinite number of motifs (assuming two real numbers are equal if they are within some specified delta &gt; 0 of each other). However, it has been shown in some motif based applications, such as multiple sequence alignment [Par98, PFR99], that a small subset of these motifs capture all the relevant information. Also, from an information-theoretic viewpoint, the special motifs represent the sets with low co-relation, hence of higher informational value. In this paper, we show, for any sequence with n characters, there exists only a linear (or no more than 3n) number of these special motifs and every other motif can be constructed from this set. We term these special motifs as irredundant motifs. We also present an efficient polynomial time algorithm to generate these motifs. This bound on the number of useful motifs gives validation to motif-based approaches, since the total number of irredundant motifs does not explode. This result is potentially of significance to most application.
acm345243	A comparison of set-based and graph-based visualisations of overlapping classification hierarchies	acm345513	AVI: Proceedings of the working conference on Advanced visual interfaces	41	50	authors kit, conference publications, guides, instructions	3	P192201	2000	13	The visualisation of hierarchical information sets has been a staple of Information Visualisation since the field came into being in the early 1990's. However, at present, support for visualising the correlations between multiple, overlapping sets of hierarchical information has been lacking. This is despite the realisation that for certain tasks this information is as important as the information that forms the individual hierarchies. In response to this, we have produced two early visualisation prototypes, one based on a graph visualisation, and the other on a set-based metaphor, that endeavour to display such information in a readily perceived form to potential users. The science of botanical taxonomy is used as an example of a field where such a visualisation would be useful, and also as a resource for example information sets that the prototypes can act upon. Technical and perceptual issues involved in the design and implementation of both prototypes are discussed. Following this, informal user testing on both prototypes is described, which utilised user observation techniques to elicit qualitative feedback from the taxonomists. These findings are then used to emphasise the shortcomings and advantages of each prototype, and from these probable issues for future prototyping and development are drawn.

Many such systems exist, ranging from computer-aided design (CAD) systems for chip design that display both the logical structure and the actual geometry of the integrated circuit to overview-plus-detail systems that show both an overview for context and a zoomed-in-view for detail. Designers of these systems must make a variety of design decisions, ranging from determining layout to constructing sophisticated coordination mechanisms. Surprisingly, little work has been done to characterize these systems or to express guidelines for their design. Based on a workshop discussion of multiple views, and based on our own design and implementation experience with these systems, we present eight guidelines for the design of multiple view systems.

A distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events. The use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems. The algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.

By using an extension of traditional structure information, or a geometric hierarchy, five significant improvements to current techniques are possible. First, the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. Second, a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene. Third, "clipping" becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of view. Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical "working set," or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm. Finally, the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent, visible surface algorithm in which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene.

We are investigating whether it benefits users to have sets of thumbnails arranged according to their mutual similarity, so images that are alike are placed together. There are, of course, many possible definitions of "similarity": so far we have explored measurements based on low-level visual features, and on the textual captions assigned to the images. Here we describe two experiments, both involving designers as the participants, examining whether similarity-based arrangements of the candidate images are helpful for a picture selection task. Firstly, the two types of similarity-based arrangement were informally compared. Then, an arrangement based on visual similarity was more formally compared with a control of a random arrangement. We believe this work should be of interest to anyone designing a system that involves presenting sets of images to users.

But what improvements do these 3D interfaces offer over their traditional 2D counterparts? This paper describes the comparative evaluation of two document management systems that differ only in the number of dimensions used for displaying and interacting with the data. The 3D system is heavily based on Robertson et al.'s Data Mountain, which supports users in storing, organizing and retrieving "thumbnail" representations of documents such as bookmarked Web-pages. Results show that our subjects were faster at storing and retrieving pages in the display when using the 2D interface, but not significantly so. As expected, retrieval times significantly increased as the number of thumbnails increased. Despite the lack of significant differences between the 2D and 3D interfaces, subjective assessments showed a significant preference for the 3D interface.

We identify the problems of processing queries in high-dimensional space, and we provide an overview of the proposed approaches to overcome these problems.

Logging is done through a proxy, overcoming many of the problems with server-side and client-side logging. Captured usage traces can be aggregated and visualized in a zooming interface that shows the web pages people viewed. The visualization also shows the most common paths taken through the website for a given task, as well as the optimal path for that task as designated by the designer. This paper discusses the architecture of WebQuilt and also describes how it can be extended for new kinds of analyses and visualizations.

We have developed a method for showing the uncertainty information together with data with minimal distraction. This method uses procedurally generated annotations which are deformed according to the uncertainty information. As another possible technique we propose distorting glyphs according to the uncertainty information.
acm375245	FastSplats: optimized splatting on rectilinear grids	acm375213	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the conference on Visualization '00	219	226	design, measurement, performance, reliability	4	P139655	2000	2	Our approach does not use texture mapping hardware, but supports the whole pipeline in memory. In such an integrated pipeline, we are then able to study the optimization strategies and address image quality issues. While this research is meant for a study of the inherent trade-off of splatting, our renderer, purley in software, achieves 3 to 5 times speedups over a top-end texture hardware (for opaque data sets) implementation. We further propose a way of efficient occlusion culling using a summed area table of opacity. 3D solid texturing and bump mapping capabilities are demonstrated to show the flexibility of such an integrated rendering pipeline. A detailed numerical error analysis, in addition to the performance and storage issues, is also presented. Our approach requires low storage and uses simple operations. Thus, it is easily implementable in hardware.

To do this, a system designer disintegrates complex applications into modular components. By interactively connecting simple components, the user constructs a complete graphics application that matches the needs of a task. A connection manager controls the flow of data between individual components. As a result, we replace the usual user-machine dialog with a dynamic live performance that is orchestrated by the user.

Three of four of these controllers are "new" in that they extend traditional direct manipulation techniques to a 3-D environment. User performance is compared during simple and complex rotation tasks. The results indicate faster performance for complex rotations using the new continuous axes controllers compared to more traditional slider approaches. No significant differences in accuracy for complex rotations were found across the virtual controllers.A second study compared the best of these four virtual controllers (the Virtual Sphere) to a control device by Evans, Tanner and Wein. No significant differences either in time to complete rotation task or accuracy of performance were found. All but one subject indicated they preferred the Virtual Sphere because it seemed more "natural".

The third dimension provides an extra degree of freedom for conveying information, much as color adds to black-and-white images, animation adds to static images, and sound adds to silent animations. The examples in this paper illustrate three fundamental uses of 3D: for providing additional information about objects that are intrinsically two-dimensional, for uniting multiple views, and for capturing a history of execution. The application of dynamic three-dimensional graphics to program visualization is largely unexplored.

Examples from two applications are given: medical imaging and molecular graphics.

Consequently they do not provide many of the capabilities for graphical information hiding and structure manipulation that a tree makes possible. This paper describes display techniques developed for IGD, a hypertext system that supports the creation of large graphical documents whose arbitrary directed graph structure is embedded in a strict hierarchy. IGD offers the full generality of arbitrary keyworded links, while simultaneously allowing hierarchies to be easily manipulated and displayed with much of their structural detail selectively abstracted.

acm502580	Funnel report mining for the MSN network	acm502512	Conference on Knowledge Discovery in Data: Proceedings of the seventh ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining	450	455	null	3	P279080	2001	1	Data mining research has long concentrated on the five main areas: clustering, association discovery, classification, forecasting and sequential patterns. Web data mining projects are concerned mainly with text mining, user segmentation, forecasting web usage and analyzing users' clickstream patterns. We present a new type of web usage mining called funnel analysis or funnel report mining. A funnel report is a study of the retention behavior among a series of pages or sites. For example, of all hits on the home page of www.msn.com, what percentages of those are followed by hits to moneycentral.msn.com? What percentage of www.msn.com hits are followed by moneycentral.msn.com, and then www.msnbc.com? What are the most interesting funnels starting with www.msn.com? Where does the greatest drop off rate occur after a user has hit MSNBC? Funnel reports are extremely useful in e-business because they give product planners an idea of how usable and well-structured their site is. From our experience performing web usage mining for the MSN network ol y sites, funnel reports are requested even more than user segmentation analyses, site affiliation studies and classification exercises. In this paper, we define a framework for funnel analysis and provide a tree-based solution we have been using successfully to extract all relevant funnels using only one scan of the data file.

These ordered treemap algorithms ensure that items near each other in the given order will be near each other in the treemap layout. Using experimental evidence from Monte Carlo trials and from actual stock market data, we show that, compared to other layout algorithms, ordered treemaps are more stable, while maintaining relatively favorable aspect ratios of the constituent rectangles. A user study with 20 participants clarifies the human performance benefits of the new algorithms. Finally, we present quantum treemap algorithms, which modify the layout of the continuous treemap algorithms to generate rectangles that are integral multiples of an input object size. The quantum treemap algorithm has been applied to PhotoMesa, an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images.
acm57182	An empirical comparison of pie vs. linear menus	acm57167	Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems	95	100	menus, user interface, empirical studies, directional selection	4	P120983	1988	3	Menus are largely formatted in a linear fashion listing items from the top to bottom of the screen or window. Pull down menus are a common example of this format. Bitmapped computer displays, however, allow greater freedom in the placement, font, and general presentation of menus. A pie menu is a format where the items are placed along the circumference of a circle at equal radial distances from the center. Pie menus gain over traditional linear menus by reducing target seek time, lowering error rates by fixing the distance factor and increasing the target size in Fitts's Law, minimizing the drift distance after target selection, and are, in general, subjectively equivalent to the linear style.

The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up operators, (2) shows how they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new aggregate functions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques to compute the cube. Many of these features are being added to the SQL Standard.

They allow trading space overhead for number of distance evaluations performed at query time. With additional search structures (that pose extra space overhead) they can also reduce the amount of side computations. We introduce a new data structure, the Fixed Queries Array (FQA), whose novelties are (1) it permits sublinear extra CPU time without any extra data structure; (2) it permits trading number of pivot points for their precision so as to make better use of the available memory. We show experimentally that the FQA is an efficient tool to search in metric spaces and that it compares favorably against other state of the art approaches. Its simplicity converts it into a simple yet effective tool for practitioners seeking for a black-box method to plug into their applications.

Advantages described include: ease of program construction (visual programming), an open (nonproprietary) architecture, simple component-based integration and advanced deployment methods. This versatility has the potential to change the nature of systems development for the geosciences, providing better mechanisms to coordinate complex functionality, and as a consequence, to improve analysis by closer integration of software tools and better engagement of the human expert. Two example applications are presented to illustrate the potentia l of the Studio environment for exploring and better understanding large, complex geographical datasets and for supporting complex visual and computational analysis.

Despite these challenges, important concepts for visualization design and use have begun to emerge. A history of the practice of implementing and using visualization in performance analysis tools reveals an underlying theory in the form of an abstract model of performance visualization and applied visualization concepts. The model is based on the integration of performance evaluation models and performance displays. The concepts involve aspects of context, scaling, user perception and interaction, comparison, and extraction of information. Several performance scenarios demonstrate how to apply the model and concepts and principles in real tools to overcome the problems of understanding performance. These scenarios measure utilization and communication, utilization statistics, data access, and parallel performance optimization. The model and concepts form a solid basis for future research in parallel performance visualization.
acm614078	Creating an Accurate Portrayal of Concurrent Executions	acm614060	IEEE Concurrency: Volume 6 , Issue 1 (January 1998): 	36	46	null	2	P75982	1998	0	Understanding and analyzing the execution of parallel and distributed systems is both important and challenging. Researchers have developed visualization tools to support users in confronting this challenge. However, experience shows that these tools can mislead as well as inform the viewer. This article discusses ways that visualization systems can hinder the viewer's comprehension of a program's execution. It then presents three characteristics that visualizations of concurrent systems should exhibit to promote an understanding of concurrent computations. The authors reveal how visualizations with reorderable, synchronous, and independent displays support an accurate representation of concurrent computations. They also describe the implementation of these essential characteristics with their own visualization tool environment, called Parade.

Fortunately, data on networks is plentiful; by visualizing this data, it is possible to greatly improve our understanding. Our focus is on visualizing the data associated with a network and not on simply visualizing the structure of the network itself. We begin with three static network displays; two of these use geographical relationships, while the third is a matrix arrangement that gives equal emphasis to all network links. Static displays can be swamped with large amounts of data; hence we introduce direct-manipulation techniques that permit the graphs to continue to reveal relationships in the context of much more data. In effect, the static displays are parameterized so that interesting views may easily be discovered interactively. The software to carry out this network visualization is called SeeNet.
acm614294	Visualization of Multidimensional Shape and Texture Features in Laser Range Data Using Complex-Valued Gabor Wavelets	acm614257	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics: Volume 1 , Issue 1 (March 1995): 	44	59	Feature-based visualization, feature extraction, wavelet transform, Gabor wavelets, multidimensional visualization, subspace mapping, principal components, shape, and texture analysis.	2	P191495	1995	0	This paper describes a new method for visualization and analysis of multivariate laser range data using complex-valued non-orthogonal Gabor wavelets, principal component analysis and a topological mapping network. The initial data set that provides both shape and texture information is encoded in terms of both amplitude and phase of a complex valued 2D image function. A set of carefully designed oriented Gabor filters performs a decomposition of the data and allows for retrieving local shape and texture features. The feature vector obtained from this method is multidimensional and in order to evaluate similar data features, further subspace methods to transform the data onto visualizable attributes, such as R, G, B, have to be determined. For this purpose, a feature-based visualization pipeline is proposed consisting of principal component analysis, normalization and a topological mapping network. This process finally renders a R, G, B subspace representation of the multidimensional feature vector. Our method is primarily applied to the visual analysis of features in human faces_but is not restricted to that.

We discuss how limiting the domain makes it possible to create a system that enables others to use it easily. Knowledge about the domain can be very helpful in building a system which automates large parts of the users task. A system can be designed to isolate the user from any concern about how graphics is done. The application need only specify what happens and need not be concerned with how to make it happen on the screen. We develop a conceptual model and a framework for experimenting with it. We also present a system, GASP, which implements this model. GASP allows quick generation of three-dimensional geometric algorithm visualizations, even for highly complex algorithms. It also provides a visual debugging facility for geometric computing. We show the utility of GASP by presenting a variety of examples.

Graphs appear in numerous applications such as web browsing, state-transition diagrams, and data structures. The ability to visualize and to navigate in these potentially large, abstract graphs is often a crucial part of an application. Information visualization has specific requirements, which means that this survey approaches the results of traditional graph drawing from a different perspective.
acm614457	Structure-Based Brushes: A Mechanism for Navigating Hierarchically Organized Data and Information Spaces	acm614278	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics: Volume 6 , Issue 2 (April 2000): 	150	159	Brushing, hierarchical representation, interactive selection, exploratory data analysis.	3	P305826	2000	0	Interactive selection is a critical component in exploratory visualization, allowing users to isolate subsets of the displayed information for highlighting, deleting, analysis, or focused investigation. Brushing, a popular method for implementing the selection process, has traditionally been performed in either screen space or data space. In this paper, we introduce an alternate, and potentially powerful, mode of selection that we term structure-based brushing, for selection in data sets with natural or imposed structure. Our initial implementation has focused on hierarchically structured data, specifically very large multivariate data sets structured via hierarchical clustering and partitioning algorithms. The structure-based brush allows users to navigate hierarchies by specifying focal extents and level-of-detail on a visual representation of the structure. Proximity-based coloring, which maps similar colors to data that are closely related within the structure, helps convey both structural relationships and anomalies. We describe the design and implementation of our structure-based brushing tool. We also validate its usefulness using two distinct hierarchical visualization techniques, namely hierarchical parallel coordinates and tree-maps. Finally, we discuss relationships between different classes of brushes and identify methods by which structure-based brushing could be extended to alternate data structures.

The thematic changes are shown in the context of a time line and corresponding external events. The focus on temporal thematic change within a context framework allows a user to discern patterns that suggest relationships or trends. For example, the sudden change of thematic strength following an external event may indicate a causal relationship. Such patterns are not readily accessible in other visualizations of the data. We use a river metaphor to convey several key notions. The document collection's time line, selected thematic content, and thematic strength are indicated by the river's directed flow, composition, and changing width, respectively. The directed flow from left to right is interpreted as movement through time and the horizontal distance between two points on the river defines a time interval. At any point in time, the vertical distance, or width, of the river indicates the collective strength of the selected themes. Colored currents flowing within the river represent individual themes. A current's vertical width narrows or broadens to indicate decreases or increases in the strength of the individual theme.
acm614510	MGV: A System for Visualizing Massive Multidigraphs	acm614285	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics: Volume 8 , Issue 1 (January 2002): 	21	38	External memory, visualization, massive data sets, graphs, hierarchies.	2	P131535	2002	0	We describe MGV, an integrated visualization and exploration system for massive multidigraph navigation. It adheres to the Visual Information-Seeking Mantra: overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand. MGV's only assumption is that the vertex set of the underlying digraph corresponds to the set of leaves of a predetermined tree $T$. MGV builds an out-of-core graph hierarchy and provides mechanisms to plug in arbitrary visual representations for each graph hierarchy slice. Navigation from one level to another of the hierarchy corresponds to the implementation of a drill-down interface. In order to provide the user with navigation control and interactive response, MGV incorporates a number of visualization techniques like interactive pixel-oriented 2D and 3D maps, statistical displays, color maps, multilinked views, and a zoomable label based interface. This makes the association of geographic information and graph data very natural. To automate the creation of the vertex set hierarchy for MGV, we use the notion of graph sketches. They can be thought of as visual indices that guide the navigation of a multigraph too large to fit on the available display. MGV follows the client-server paradigm and it is implemented in C and Java-3D. We highlight the main algorithmic and visualization techniques behind the tools and, along the way, point out several possible application scenarios. Our techniques are being applied to multigraphs defined on vertex sets with sizes ranging from 100 million to 250 million vertices.

As I'll indicate, this is not easy, for the survey's information content will be several times larger than the entire text contained in the Library of Congress.

This application visualization system (AVS) is an application framework targeted at scientists and engineers. The goal of the system is to make applications that combine interactive graphics and high computational requirements easier to develop for both programmers and nonprogrammers. AVS is designed around the concept of software building blocks, or modules, which can be interconnected to form visualization applications. AVS allows flow networks of existing modules to be constructed using a direct-manipulation user interface, and it automatically generates a simple user interface to each module.

The merits of color scales for medical image data were studied, and it was found that, in tests, although observers performed somewhat better with the newly developed LOCS than with the previously advocated heated-object color scale, they performed significantly better with a linearized gray scale than with either of the color scales. After evaluating these results, the authors suggest alternate solutions that might help observers perform better. Nonetheless, they believe that color scales can contribute to the perception of information in images.

The main idea behind the system stems from the view of relational database tables as sets of multidimensional data where the number of attributes corresponds to the number of dimensions. In such a view, it is often unclear. In this system, each display pixel represents one database item. Pixels are arranged and colored to indicate the item's relevance to a user query and to give a visual impression of the resulting data set.

We have been developing a workspace called Visage to address both types of analysis tasks. Our goal is for expert users to move easily between routine tasks and exploratory data analysis as situations demand. Furthermore, recognizing the inherent complexity of data analysis, we want a system that is accessible to occasional users yet simultaneously provides power and flexibility for expert users. Ideally, such a system should support a gradual shift to increasing expertise so that occasional users of routine interfaces can perform more detailed analyses if needed. Visage addresses these needs by providing a consistent interface to a wide variety of data manipulation and visualization primitives. Plus, it lets users combine these operations to create appliances-special-purpose applications capturing multiple steps of a routine data analysis process-in a single, simple interface. Analysts thus benefit from a common set of operations and ways to integrate information across applications. Visage provides both basic tools and specialized information appliances to help them.

Several visual exploration techniques have been proposed for 2D information layouts. Many of these try to take advantage of humans' natural visual pattern-recognition abilities to understand global relationships while simultaneously integrating this knowledge with local details. This desire for detail-in-context views (also called fisheye, multiscale and distortion views) has fueled considerable research in the development of distortion viewing tools. Generally, these tools provide space for magnification of local detail by compressing the rest of the image. In considering a possible detail-in-context view for 3D layouts, we first examine 2D distortion techniques, bearing in mind the particular 3D problem of occlusion. Comparing 2D and 3D information layout adjustment tools leads directly to a 3D visual access tool that clears a line of sight to any region of interest. While our technique can extend to any type of 3D information display, we focus on graphs.

The crowd is not necessarily fickle; some points are genuinely more important than others because a tennis match is hierarchically structured. One match consists of several sets. One set consists of several games. One game consists of several points. The match-winning point is the most important one. How can we make that importance visible? Our goal is to let a fan, a player, or a coach examine tennis data visually, extract the interesting parts, and jump from one item to another quickly and easily. The visualization tool should help parse the elements of a match. We developed an interactive system called TennisViewer to visualize the dynamic, tree-structured data representing a tennis match. It provides an interface for users to quickly explore tennis match information. The visualization tool reveals the overall structure of the match as well as the fine details in a single screen. It uses a 2D display of translucent layers, a design that contains elements of Tree-Maps and of the Visual Scheduler system, which was designed to help faculty and students identify mutually available (transparent) time slots when arranging group meetings. TennisViewer provides MagicLens filters to explore specialized views of the information and a time-varying display to animate all or part of a match.

It uses visualization and data mining to arrive at interesting results. Providing diverse visualization tools lets users choose the most appropriate method for a given problem. The client-server architecture performs most of the computationally intensive tasks on a server, while the processed results return to the client for visualization. The paper discusses MineSet database visualization and data mining visualization.

Hyperbolic space and spanning trees can reduce visual clutter, speed up layout, and provide fluid interaction. This article briefly describes a software system that explicitly attempts to handle much larger graphs than previous systems and support dynamic exploration rather than final presentation. It then discusses the applicability of this system to goals beyond simple exploration. A software system that supports graph exploration should include both a layout and an interactive drawing component. I have developed new algorithms for both layout and drawing (H3 and H3Viewer). The H3Viewer drawing algorithm remains under development, so this article presents preliminary results. I have implemented a software library that uses these algorithms. It can handle graphs of more than 100,000 edges by using a spanning tree as the backbone for the layout and drawing algorithms.

A set of components describing structural and geometrical elements of plants maps to a graph that forms the description of a specific plant and generates the geometry. Users get immediate feedback on what they've created-geometrical parameters, tropisms, and free-form deformations can control the overall shape of a plant. We demonstrate that our method handles the complexity of most real plants.

They capture, communicate, and leverage knowledge indispensable for solving problems and act as cognitive externalizations (intertwining internal and external processes to extract information from the external world to enhance thought). A diagram provides a mapping from the problem domain to the visual representation by supporting cognitive processes that involve perceptual pattern finding and cognitive symbolic operations. However, not all mappings are equal, and for effectiveness we must embed a diagram's representation with characteristics, which lets users easily perceive meaningful patterns. Consequently, a diagram's effectiveness depends to some extent on how well we construct it as an input to our visual system. In our research, we focus on a class of diagrams commonly referred to as graphs or node-link diagrams. Nodes representing entities, objects, or processes, and links or edges representing relationships between the nodes characterize them. Their most common form is outline circles or boxes denoting nodes and lines of different types representing links between the nodes. Entity-relationship diagrams, software structure diagrams, and data-flow models are examples of node-link diagrams used to model the structure of processes, software, or data.

These collections have created a need for new methods to locate specific images or video clips. The Query by Image Content (QBIC) project is studying methods to extend and complement text-based retrievals by querying and retrieving images and videos by content. Queries can be performed using attributes such as colors, textures, shapes, and object position. Video-specific queries include those on camera motion parameters like zoom, pan, and object motion. The project has resulted in a prototype system with two major steps: database population and query. In population, methods identify objects in still images, segment videos into short sequences called shots, and compute features describing color, texture, shape, position, or motion information. In database query, images and shots can be retrieved by example ("Show me images similar to this image") or by selecting properties from pickers such as a color wheel, a sketched shape, a list of camera motions, or a combination of these. Key QBIC technical issues include a visual query language and a graphical user interface that lets users form a query by painting, sketching, or selecting graphical elements. Key also are indexing techniques for high-dimensional features describing image and video content, automatic segmentation techniques for images (to identify interesting objects), and videos (to identify shots and interesting moving and static objects), and similarity retrieval (to match human perception). QBIC technology has moved into the Ultimedia and Digital Library commercial IBM products.

It facilitates rigorous machine specification by providing specification templates at both the architecture and microarchitecture levels.

The authors have evolved four innovative visual representations of code to help solve this problem: line representation; pixel representation; file summary representation; and hierarchical representation. We first describe these four visual code representations and then discuss the interaction techniques for manipulating them. We illustrate our software visualization techniques through five case studies. The first three focus on software history and static software characteristics; the last two discuss execution behavior. The software library and its implementation are then described. Finally, we briefly review some related work and compare and contrast our different techniques for visualizing software.

It fetches and decodes four instructions per cycle and dynamically issues them to five fully-pipelined, low-latency execution units. Instructions can be fetched and executed speculatively beyond branches. Instructions graduate in order upon completion. Although execution is out of order, the processor still provides sequential memory consistency and precise exception handling. The R10000 is designed for high performance, even in large, real-world applications with poor memory locality. With speculative execution, it calculates memory addresses and initiates cache refills early. Its hierarchical, nonblocking memory system helps hide memory latency with two levels of set-associative, write-back caches.

Potential support that a UIMS can provide to evaluators of user interfaces generated by the UIMS are discussed. Metrics for measuring interactive behavior have been implemented as part of a User Interface Management System. It is shown how the external control and separate dialogue description features of UIMSs make possible such measurements. These metrics are automatically mapped back to the responsible portions of the dialogue description. Reports are generated which aid interface evaluators in locating specific problems in a user interface design.

Faust includes a project-management tool, a context editor that is interfaced to a program database, and performance-evaluation tools. In Faust, all applications work is done in the context of projects, which serve as the focal point for all tool interactions. A project roughly corresponds to an executable program. Faust achieves functional integration through operations on common data sets maintained in each project. Sigma, a Faust tool designed to help users of parallel supercomputers retarget and optimize application code, helps them either fine-tune parallel code that has been automatically generated or optimize a new parallel algorithm's design. Faust includes a dynamic call-graph tool and an integrated, multiprocessor performance analysis and characterization tool set.

However, there is considerable confusion over the terminology used in both technical and marketplace discussions. The authors define and relate six terms: forward engineering, reverse engineering, redocumentation, design recovery, restructuring, and reengineering. The objective is not to create new terms but to rationalize the terms already in use. The resulting definitions apply to the underlying engineering processes, regardless of the degree of automation applied.

Present algorithms either do not let you draw tree nodes of varying shapes and sizes or they draw such trees in a way that does not produce trees as compact as they could be, which is especially important when diagramming a large system. Also, they cannot reuse layout information when the trees changes, so after every change the layout must be recomputed and the tree redrawn. The main difference between these traditional approaches and the author's approach is that his algorithm is more geometric. Unlike other algorithms, it uses an explicit representation of node and subtree contours, and it stores every contour as a polygon. It has three advantages over traditional algorithms. It allows one to draw trees with nodes of any polygonal shape compactly. The data structure supports insert and delete operations on subtrees. It is simple to implement, yet flexible.

Most designers merely use two one-dimensional scroll bars or ad hoc designs for two-dimensional scroll bars. However, the complexity of two-dimensional browsing suggests that more careful analysis, design, and evaluation might lead to significant improvements. Our exploration of existing 2D browsers has led us to identify many features and a wide variety of tasks performed with the browsers. We introduce an informal specification technique to describe 2D browsers and a task taxonomy, suggest design features and guidelines, and assess existing strategies. We focus on the tools to explore a selected image and so do not cover techniques to browse a series of images or to browse large-image databases.

In this article, we describe and evaluate a new visualization-based approach to mining large databases. The basic idea of our visual data mining techniques is to represent as many data items as possible on the screen at the same time by mapping each data value to a pixel of the screen and arranging the pixels adequately. The major goal of this article is to evaluate our visual data mining techniques and to compare them to other well-known visualization techniques for multidimensional data: the parallel coordinate and stick-figure visualization techniques. For the evaluation of visual data mining techniques, the perception of data properties counts most, while the CPU time and the number of secondary storage accesses are only of secondary importance. In addition to testing the visualization techniques using real data, we developed a testing environment for database visualizations similar to the benchmark approach used for comparing the performance of database systems. The testing environment allows the generation of test data sets with predefined data characteristics which are important for comparing the perceptual abilities of visual data mining techniques.

The transformation that takes the contour to its canonical form is a member of the projective group PGL(2), chosen because PGL(2) contains all possible transformations of a plane curve under central projection onto another plane. The scheme relies on solving computationally an "isoperimetric" problem in which a transformation is sought which maximises the area of a curve given unit perimeter. In the case that the transformation is restricted to the affine subgroup there is a unique extremising transformation for any piecewise smooth closed curve. Uniqueness holds, almost always, even for curves that are not closed. In the full projective case, isoperimetric normalization is well-defined only for closed curves. We have found computational counterexamples for which there is more than one extremal transformation. Numerical algorithms are described and demonstrated both for the affine and the projective cases. Once a canonical curve is obtained, its isoperimetric area can be regarded as an invariant descriptor of shape.

The fist pass finds an optimal rank assignment using a network simplex algorithm. The seconds pass sets the vertex order within ranks by an iterative heuristic, incorporating a novel weight function and local transpositions to reduce crossings. The third pass finds optimal coordinates for nodes by constructing and ranking an auxiliary graph. The fourth pass makes splines to draw edges. The algorithm creates good drawings and is fast.

acm63669	Evaluating the effectiveness of reliability-assurance techniques	acm63666	Journal of Systems and Software: Volume 9 , Issue 3 (March 1989): 	191	195	Management, Measurement, Performance, Reliability	2	P131935	1989	0	In the software-development life cycle, various reliability assurance techniques are routinely performed in an attempt to reduce the number of errors in a software product. These reliability-assurance techniques commonly consist of a variety of technical reviews and several levels of testing. Although the utilization of these techniques is growing, there is a lack of quantitative data on their effectiveness. This paper describes two metrics, error-detection efficiency and cost effectiveness, which were used to evaluate the reliability-assurance techniques employed in a large software project. The results of the study are also presented.

However, these networks frequently overwhelm the user and become a source of confusion. Within Intermedia, we have developed the Web View-a tool for viewing and navigating such networks with a minimum of user confusion and disorientation. The key factors in the Web View's success are a display that combines a record of the user's path through the network with a map of the currently available links; a scope line that summarizes the number of documents and links in the network; and a set of commands that permit the user to open documents directly from the Web View.

We use the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to map time sequences to the frequency domain, the crucial observation being that, for most sequences of practical interest, only the first few frequencies are strong. Another important observation is Parseval's theorem, which specifies that the Fourier transform preserves the Euclidean distance in the time or frequency domain.

Our goal is to support the process of data mining by representing as many data items as possible on the display. By arranging and coloring the data items as pixels according to their relevance for the query, the user gets a visual impression of the resulting data set. Using an interactive query interface, the user may change the query dynamically and receives immediate feedback by the visual representation of the resulting data set. Furthermore, by using multiple windows for different parts of a complex query, the user gets visual feedback for each part of the query and, therefore, may easier understand the overall result. Our system allows to represent the largest amount of data that can be visualized on current display technology, provides valuable feedback in querying the database, and allows the user to find results which, otherwise, would remain hidden in the database.

We believe that visualization can help in the process. In this paper we discuss heretofore unaddressed issues in the visualization of concurrent programs, and present the Animation Choreographer. The Animation Choreographer allows users to view, manipulate, and explore the set of alternate feasible orderings of the program execution under study, both through the Choreographer interface and in the context of the selected visualizations, thus providing the user with a variety of temporal perspectives on the computation.
acm671516	Similarity Search in High Dimensions via Hashing	acm645925	Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases	518	529	null	3	P21454	1999	0	The nearest- or near-neighbor query problems arise in a large variety of database applications, usually in the context of similarity searching. Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the "curse of dimensionality." That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should suffice for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart. We provide experimental evidence that our method gives significant improvement in running time over other methods for searching in highdimensional spaces based on hierarchical tree decomposition. Experimental results also indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively large number of dimensions (more than 50).

The model allows the am- plitude of one of the two sequences to be scaled by any suitable amount and its offset adjusted appropriately. Two subsequences are considered similar if one can be enclosed within an envelope of a specified width drawn around the other. The model also allows non-matching gaps in the matching subsequences. The matching sub-sequences need not be aligned along the time axis. Given this model of similarity, we present fast search techniques for discovering all similar sequences in a set of sequences. These techniques can also be used to find all (sub)sequences similar to a given sequence. We applied this matching system to the U.S. mutual funds data and discovered interesting matches.

MineSet represents the confluence of several important software and hardware technolo-gies: data mining algorithms, fast multiprocessing database servers, novel techniques for interactive 3-D data visual-ization, and powerful graphics workstations. MineSet provides integrated facilities for the extraction of data from var-ied sources, algorithms for mining the extracted data, and tools for the 3-D visualization of results. The mining al-gorithms allow for the discovery of previously unknown nuggets of information, while the sophisticated visualiza-tions allow the user to get a better understanding of both the data mining results, and also the interrelationships amongthe raw data ("visual data mining"). Underlying all these techniques is the ability to handle large data sets. 
acm673502	The X-tree: An Index Structure for High-Dimensional Data	acm645922	Proceedings of the 22th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases	28	39	null	3	P267223	1996	6	In this paper, we propose a new method for indexing large amounts of point and spatial data in highdimensional space. An analysis shows that index structures such as the R*-tree are not adequate for indexing high-dimensional data sets. The major problem of R-tree-based index structures is the overlap of the bounding boxes in the directory, which increases with growing dimension. To avoid this problem, we introduce a new organization of the directory which uses a split algorithm minimizing overlap and additionally utilizes the concept of supernodes. The basic idea of overlap-minimizing split and supernodes is to keep the directory as hierarchical as possible, and at the same time to avoid splits in the directory that would result in high overlap. Our experiments show that for high-dimensional data, the X-tree outperforms the well-known R*-tree and the TV-tree by up to two orders of magnitude.

This linking of visualizations, together with the possibility to interactively manipulate data, enable an analyst to display the same data set with a number of conceptually different visualization methods simultaneously and to carry out graphical operations across them. Graphical effects in different displays not only reveal information about the data themselves, they also provide the basis to investigate how the different visualization methods relate to each other. With the "VisuLab", we developed a software tool for personal computers to investigate comparative multivariate data visualization.

Previous research has produced solutions which are visually complex with respect to the number of crossings. In this paper we focus our attention on developing better and more efficient circular drawing algorithms. In particular we present an tex2html_wrap_inline99 algorithm which lays out a biconnected graph onto a single embedding circle. Furthermore, we can guarantee that if a zero crossing circular embedding exists for an input graph, then our algorithm will find it. Also, the results of extensive experiments conducted over a set of 10,328 biconnected graphs and show our technique to perform significantly better than the current technology.

In this paper, weexamine the effects of employing more natural representations in GUIs. In particular, we experimentallyassess the impact of object form (2D iconic versus 3D realistic) and layout (regular versus ecological) haveon target acquisition time. Results indicate that both form and layout significantly affect performance;subjects located targets more quickly when using interfaces with 3D objects and ecological layouts thanthey do with 2D objects and regular layouts. An interface with an ecological layout, realistic objects, orboth may be an improvement over traditional interfaces.

We report on development and use of one component of a prototype GVis environment designed to facilitate exploration, by domain experts, of time series multivariate georeferenced health statistics. Emphasis is on how manipulable dynamic GVis tools may facilitate visual thinking, pattern noticing, and hypothesis generation. The prototype facilitates the highlighting of data extremes, examination of change in geographic patterns over time, and exploration of similarity among georeferenced variables. A qualitative exploratory analysis of verbal protocols and transaction logs is used to characterize system use. Evidence produced through the characterization highlights differences among experts in data analysis strategies (particularly in relation to the use of attribute "focusing combined with time series animation) and corresponding differences in success at noticing spatiotemporal patterns.

A number of tools are described for dealing with this problem effectively. These tools can be applied to any continuous nonlinear magnification system, and are not tied to specific implementation features of the system that produced the original transformation. Of particular interest is the development of "seamless multi-level views", which allow multiple global views of an information space (each having different information content) to be integrated into a single view without discontinuity.

This paper presents several novel visual methods from an information analyst's perspective. We present a sample scenario, using the various methods to gain a variety of insights from a large information collection. We conclude that no single paradigm or visual method is sufficient for many analytical tasks. Often a suite of integrated methods offers a better analytic environment in today's emerging culture of information overload and rapidly changing issues. We also conclude that the interactions among these visual paradigms are equally as important as, if not more important than, the paradigms themselves.

While algorithm animations typically rely on user augmented source code to produce visualizations, debuggers make use of symbolic information in the target program. As a result, visualizations produced by debuggers often lack important semantic content, making them inferior to algorithm animation systems. This paper presents a method to provide higher-level, more informative visualizations in a debugger using a technique called traversal-based visualization. The debugger traverses a data structure using a set of user-supplied patterns to identify parts of the data structure to be drawn a similar way. A declarative language is used to specify the patterns and the actions to take when the patterns are encountered. Alternatively, the user can construct traversal specifications through a graphical user interface to the declarative language. Furthermore, the debugger supports modification of data. Changes made to the on-screen representation are reflected in the underlying data.

The course of development is roughly organized into four stages, within which major milestones are discussed. Recently developed techniques are explored with examples.

Pertinent properties may include straightness of lines, graph topology, orthogonalities and proximities. A layout adjustment algorithm which can be used to create fisheye views of nested graphs is introduced. The SHriMP (Simple Hierarchical Multi-Perspective) visualization technique uses this algorithm to create fisheye views of nested graphs. This algorithm preserves straightness of lines and uniformly resizes nodes when requests for more screen space are made. In contrast to other layout adjustment algorithms, this algorithm has several variants to preserve additional selected properties of the original graph. These variants use different layout strategies to reposition nodes when the graph is distorted. The SHriMP visualization technique is demonstrated through its application to visualizing structures in large software systems.

Hierarchical graphs are graphs with layering structures; clustered graphs are graphs with recursive clustering structures. Both have applications in CASE tools, software visualization, and VLSI design. Drawing algorithms for hierarchical graphs have been well investigated. However, the problem of straight-line representation has not been solved completely. In this paper, we answer the question: does every planar hierarchical graph admit a planar straight-line hierarchical drawing? We present an algorithm that constructs such drawings in linear time. Also, we answer a basic question for clustered graphs, that is, does every planar clustered graph admit a planar straight-line drawing with clusters drawn as convex polygons? We provide a method for such drawings based on our algorithm for hierarchical graphs.

For graphical representation, the clustering structure is rep- resented by a simple region that contains the drawing of all the vertices which belong to that cluster. In this paper, we present an algorithm which produces planar drawings of clustered graphs in a convention known as orthogonal grid rectangular cluster drawings. If the input graph has n vertices, then the algorithm produces in O(n) time a drawing with O(n2) area and at most 3 bends in each edge. This result is as good as existing results for classical planar graphs. Further, we show that our algorithm is optimal in terms of the number of bends per edge.

We also introduce a novel BSP-type decomposition, called the balanced aspect ratio (BAR) tree, which guarantees that the cells produced are convex and have bounded aspect ratios. In addition, the tree depth is O(log n), and its construction takes O(n log n) time, where n is the number of points. We show that the BAR tree can be used to recursively divide a graph embedded in the plane into subgraphs of roughly equal size, such that the drawing of each subgraph has a balanced aspect ratio. As a result, we obtain a representation of a graph as a collection of O(log n) layers, where each succeeding layer represents the graph in an increasing level of detail. The overall running time of the algorithm is O(n log n+m+D0 (G)), where n and m are the number of vertices and edges of the graph G, and D0 (G) is the time it takes to obtain an initial embedding of G in the plane. In particular, if the graph is planar each layer is a graph drawn with straight lines and without crossings on the n x n grid and the running time reduces to O(n log n).

In this paper we present a framework for producing circular drawings of networks represented by nonbiconnected graphs. Furthermore, the drawings produced by these techniques clearly show the biconnectivity structure of the given networks. We also include results of an extensive experimental study which shows our approach to significantly outperform the current state of the art.
acm729409	FADE: Graph Drawing, Clustering, and Visual Abstraction	acm647552	Lecture Notes In Computer Science: Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Graph Drawing	197	210	null	2	P440936	2000	1	A fast algorithm(FADE ) for the 2D drawing, geometric clustering and multilevel viewing of large undirected graphs is presented. The algorithm is an extension of the Barnes-Hut hierarchical space decomposition method, which includes edges and multilevel visual abstraction. Compared to the original force directed algorithm, the time overhead is $O(e + n \log n)$ where n and e are the numbers of nodes and edges. The improvement is possible since the decomposition tree provides a systematic way to determine the degree of closeness between nodes without explicitly calculating the distance between each node. Different types of regular decomposition trees are introduced. The decomposition tree also represents a hierarchical clustering of the nodes, which improves in a graph theoretic sense as the graph drawing approaches a lower energy state. Finally, the decomposition tree provides a mechanism to view the hierarchical clustering on various levels of abstraction. Larger graphs can be represented more concisely, on a higher level of abstraction, with fewer graphics on screen.
acm729414	A Multilevel Algorithm for Force-Directed Graph Drawing	acm647552	Lecture Notes In Computer Science: Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on Graph Drawing	171	182	null	1	P46410	2000	0	We describe a heuristic method for drawing graphs which uses a multilevel technique combined with a force-directed placement algorithm. The multilevel process groups vertices to form clusters, uses the clusters to define a new graph and is repeated until the graph size falls below some threshold. The coarsest graph is then given an initial layout and the layout is successively refined on all the graphs starting with the coarsest and ending with the original. In this way the multilevel algorithm both accelerates and gives a more global quality to the force-directed placement. The algorithm can compute both 2 and 3 dimensional layouts and we demonstrate it on a number of examples ranging from 500 to 225,000 vertices. It is also very fast and can compute a 2D layout of a sparse graph in around 30 seconds for a 10,000 vertex graph to around 10 minutes for the largest graph. This is an order of magnitude faster than recent implementations of force-directed placement algorithms.

Whenever a layout in a graph drawing system is modified, the mental map of the user must be preserved. One way in which the user can be helped in understanding a change of layout is through animation of the change. In this paper, we present clustering-based strategies for identifying groups of nodes sharing a common, simple motion from initial layout to final layout. Transformation of these groups is then handled separately in order to generate a smooth animation.

As such, many presentation emphasis techniques for visualizing graphs such as fisheye views have been proposed. A recent survey paper [9] described an abstract space of techniques and identified common shortcomings. Here we outline a highlevel language that addresses several of these limitations; the language is used to: 1) select subsets of graph elements; 2) compute a real-valued priority for each element; and, 3) encode presentation strategies that automatically emphasize elements based on subset membership and priority.
acm730925	Reduction of Visual Complexity in Dynamic Graphs	acm647546	Lecture Notes In Computer Science: Proceedings of the DIMACS International Workshop on Graph Drawing	218	225	null	4	P69495	1994	0	Graphs are used extensively in software visualization to represent both static aspects of software structure and dynamic aspects of execution-time behavior. However, for realistic subject software systems, there are far too many nodes and edges in the displayed graphs to be comprehensible to an end user. Further, for presentation of dynamics, continual change and redisplay of such large graphs is too demanding for conventional workstation computational resources. This paper poses the problem of ``reduction'' or ``abstraction'' in dynamically changing graphs, and proposes a combination of techniques that can be used to reduce the visual complexity of a graph, without obscuring the significant information that it was meant to convey. These techniques are illustrated by way of examples showing their use in systems for visualization of object-oriented and multi-layer software systems.

Recent work, however,has concentrated on integrating a locally detailed view with a globally scaled view. We present an algorithm for constructing a view which smoothly integrates local detail and global context in a single view window and describe user interaction with such a display.

However, some graphs contain so many edges that their display by traditional graph layout algorithms is virtually impossible because of the overwhelming number of crossings. Graphs representing large software systems and their configurations are particularly prone to this problem. Examples of such graphs include: graphs depicting a system's configuration, call graphs, graphs depicting import and export relationships between modules, and graphs depicting the "includes" relation among a system's source files. This paper proposes the elimination of some edges by replacing sets of edges that have the same set of source and target nodes by a special node called an edge concentration node. Reducing the number of edges often has the desirable side effect of reducing the number of crossings. An algorithm that determines a reasonable set of edge concentrations of a graph in O(n4) operations for each level in the graph is presented where n is the number of nodes in that level. Several examples from the area of software configuration management are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of using edge concentrations.

In order to fully utilize these capabilities, new software architectures must support multiple, asynchronous, interacting agents (the Multiple Agent Problem), and support smooth interactive animation (the Animation Problem). The Cognitive Coprocessor is a new user interface architecture designed to solve these two problems, while supporting highly interactive user interfaces that have 2D and 3D animations. This architecture includes 3D Rooms, a 3D analogy to the Rooms system with Rooms Buttons extended to Interactive Objects that deal with 3D, animation, and gestures. This research is being tested in the domain of Information Visualization, which uses 2D and 3D animated artifacts to represent the structure of information. A prototype, called the Information Visualizer, has been built.

The facility provides support for fault-tolerant process groups in the form of a family of reliable multicast protocols that can be used in both local- and wide-area networks. These protocols attain high levels of concurrency, while respecting application-specific delivery ordering constraints, and have varying cost and performance that depend on the degree of ordering desired. In particular, a protocol that enforces causal delivery orderings is introduced and shown to be a valuable alternative to conventional asynchronous communication protocols. The facility also ensures that the processes belonging to a fault-tolerant process group will observe consistent orderings of events affecting the group as a whole, including process failures, recoveries, migration, and dynamic changes to group properties like member rankings. A review of several uses for the protocols in the ISIS system, which supports fault-tolerant resilient objects and bulletin boards, illustrates the significant simplification of higher level algorithms made possible by our approach.
acm757113	Multilevel Visualization of Clustered Graphs	acm647548	Lecture Notes In Computer Science: Proceedings of the Symposium on Graph Drawing	101	112	null	2	P223968	1996	0	Clustered graphs are graphs with recursive clustering structures over the vertices. This type of structure appears in many systems. Examples include CASE tools, management information systems, VLSI design tools, and reverse engineering systems. Existing layout algorithms represent the clustering structure as recursively nested regions in the plane. However, as the structure becomes more and more complex, two dimensional plane representations tend to be insufficient. In this paper, firstly, we describe some two dimensional plane drawing algorithms for clustered graphs; then we show how to extend two dimensional plane drawings to three dimensional multilevel drawings. We consider two conventions: straight-line convex drawings and orthogonal rectangular drawings; and we show some examples.
acm757116	Drawing Large Graphs with H3Viewer and Site Manager	acm647550	Lecture Notes In Computer Science: Proceedings of the 6th International Symposium on Graph Drawing	384	393	null	1	P278221	1998	3	We demonstrate the H3Viewer graph drawing library, which can be run from a standalone program or in conjunction with other programs such as SGI's Site Manager application. Our layout and drawing algorithms support interactive navigation of large graphs up to 100,000 edges. We present an adaptive drawing algorithm with a guaranteed frame rate. Both layout and navigation occur in 3D hyperbolic space, which provides a view of a large neighborhood around an easily changeable point of interest. We find an appropriate spanning tree to use as the backbone for fast layout and uncluttered drawing, and non-tree links can be displayed on demand. Our methods are appropriate when node or link annotations can guide the choice of a good parent from among all of the incoming links. Such annotations can be constructed using only a small amount of domain-specific knowledge, thus rendering tractable many graphs which may seem rather densely connected at first glance.

Our technique works for arbitrary planar graphs and produces a clustering which satisfies the conditions for compound-planarity (c-planarity). Using the clustering, we obtain a representation of the graph as a collection of O(log n) layers, where each succeeding layer represents the graph in an increasing level of detail. At the same time, the diference between two graphs on neighboring layers of the hierarchy is small, thus preserving the viewer's mental map. The overall running time of the algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of vertices of graph G.

The method has two phases: first embed the graph in a very high dimension and then project it into the 2-D plane using PCA. Experiments we have carried out show the ability of the method to draw graphs of 105 nodes in few seconds. The new method appears to have several advantages over classical methods, including a significantly better running time, a useful inherent capability to exhibit the graph in various dimensions, and an effective means for interactive exploration of large graphs.

The major function of BiblioMapper is to visualize the document space with a cluster-based visualization technique. The cluster-based visualization technique assembles a set of documents according to semantic similarities. One advantage of this technique is that users are able to focus on and assess each cluster and the documents which the cluster comprises according to their information needs.

This survey of recent research focuses on debugger visualization systems. The effectiveness of such systems is bounded by the degree to which their representations of run-time behavior correlate with the language structures used to incorporate parallelism, as well as the logical framework adopted by the programmer. Current visualization systems are compared with the conceptual models supported by parallel languages. Attention is drawn to the fact that debuggers are tied to specific models and that this association may restrict their usefulness and acceptability.

The probe effect refers to the fact that any attempt to observe the behavior of a distributed system may change the behavior of that system. For some parallel programs, different executions with the same data will result in different results even without any attempt to observe the behavior. Even when the behavior can be observed, in many systems the lack of a synchronized global clock makes the results of the observation difficult to interpret. This paper discusses these and other problems related to debugging concurrent programs and presents a survey of current techniques used in debugging concurrent programs. Systems using three general techniques are described: traditional or breakpoint style debuggers, event monitoring systems, and static analysis systems. In addition, techniques for limiting, organizing, and displaying a large amount of data produced by the debugging systems are discussed.
acm769924	Visual hierarchical dimension reduction for exploration of high dimensional datasets	acm769922	ACM International Conference Proceeding Series: Proceedings of the symposium on Data visualisation 2003	19	28	dimensionality reduction, visual hierarchy, parallel coordinates, scatterplot matrices	4	P129424	2003	12	Traditional visualization techniques for multidimensional data sets, such as parallel coordinates, glyphs, and scatterplot matrices, do not scale well to high numbers of dimensions. A common approach to solving this problem is dimensionality reduction. Existing dimensionality reduction techniques usually generate lower dimensional spaces that have little intuitive meaning to users and allow little user interaction. In this paper we propose a new approach to handling high dimensional data, named Visual Hierarchical Dimension Reduction (VHDR), that addresses these drawbacks. VHDR not only generates lower dimensional spaces that are meaningful to users, but also allows user interactions in most steps of the process. In VHDR, dimensions are grouped into a hierarchy, and lower dimensional spaces are constructed using clusters of the hierarchy. We have implemented the VHDR approach into XmdvTool, and extended several traditional multidimensional visualization methods to convey dimension cluster characteristics when visualizing the data set in lower dimensional spaces. Our case study of applying VHDR to a real data set supports our belief that this approach is effective in supporting the exploration of high dimensional data sets.

To support interactive analysis, many of these databases are augmented with hierarchical structures that provide meaningful levels of abstraction that can be leveraged by both the computer and analyst. This hierarchical structure generates many challenges and opportunities in the design of systems for the query, analysis, and visualization of these databases.In this paper, we present an interactive visual exploration tool that facilitates exploratory analysis of data warehouses with rich hierarchical structure, such as might be stored in data cubes. We base this tool on Polaris, a system for rapidly constructing table-based graphical displays of multidimensional databases. Polaris builds visualizations using an algebraic formalism derived from the interface and interpreted as a set of queries to a database. We extend the user interface, algebraic formalism, and generation of data queries in Polaris to expose and take advantage of hierarchical structure. In the resulting system, analysts can navigate through the hierarchical projections of a database, rapidly and incrementally generating visualizations for each projection.
acm776774	Communicating Centrality in Policy Network Drawings	acm776751	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics: Volume 9 , Issue 2 (April 2003): 	241	253	Information visualization, graph drawing, force-directed placement, social network analysis, centrality.	3	P286704	2003	16	We introduce a network visualization technique that supports an analytical method applied in the social sciences. Policy network analysis is an approach to study policy making structures, processes, and outcomes, thereby concentrating on relations between policy actors. An important operational concept for the analysis of policy networks is the notion of centrality, i.e., the distinction of actors according to their importance in a relational structure. We integrate this measure in a layout model for networks by mapping structural to geometric centrality. Thus, centrality values and network data can be presented simultaneously and explored interactively.

The resulting input/output communication (or I/O) between fast internal memory and slower external memory (such as disks) can be a major performance bottleneck. In this paper we survey the state of the art in the design and analysis of external memory (or EM) algorithms, where the goal is to exploit locality in order to reduce the I/O costs.For sorting and related problems like permuting and fast Fourier transform, the key paradigms include distribution and merging. The paradigm of disk striping offers an elegant way to use multiple disks in parallel. For sorting, however, disk striping can be nonoptimal with respect to I/O, so to gain further improvements we discuss distribution and merging techniques for using the disks independently. We consider EM paradigms for computations involving matrixes, geometric data, and graphs, and we look at problems caused by dynamic memory allocation. We report on some experiments in the domain of spatial databases using the TPIE system (Transparent Parallel I/O programming Environment). The newly developed EM algorithms and data structures that incorporate the paradigms we discuss in this chapter are significantly faster than methods currently used in practice.

In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a two-phase approach to query formulation. The two phases are the Query Preview and the Query Refinement. In the Query Preview phase, users formulate an initial query by selecting rough attribute values. The estimated number of matching data sets is shown graphically on preview bars which allows users to rapidly focus on a manageable number of relevant data sets. Query previews also prevent wasted steps by eliminating zero-hit queries. When the estimated number of data sets is low enough, the initial query is submitted to the network, which returns the metadata of the data sets for further refinement in the Query Refinement phase. The two-phase approach to query formulation overcomes slow network performance, and reduces the data volume and data complexity problems. This approach is especially appropriate for users who do not have extensive knowledge about the data and who prefer an exploratory method to discover data patterns and exceptions. Using this approach, we have developed dynamic query user interfaces to allow users to formulate their queries across a networked environment.

The statistical tests are applied to the coefficients of images filtered by a multi-scale Gabor filter bank. We will demonstrate that these similarity measures are useful for both, texture based image retrieval and for unsupervised texture segmentation, and hence offer an unified approach to these closely related tasks. We present results on Brodatz-like micro-textures and a collection of real-word images.

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging.

Few programming systems, however, allow the programmer similar flexibility when displaying the data structures for debugging, monitoring and documenting programs. Incense is a working prototype system that allows the programmer to interactively investigate data structures in actual programs. The desired displays can be specified by the programmer or a default can be used. The default displays provided by Incense present the standard form for literals of the basic types, the actual names for scalar types, stacked boxes for records and arrays, and curved lines with arrowheads for pointers. In addition to displaying data structures, Incense also allows the user to select, move, erase and redimension the resulting displays. These interactions are provided in a uniform, natural manner using a pointing device (mouse ) and keyboard.

Pertinent information, scattered throughout the literature of psychology, graphic design. linguistics, hardware design, and under the general umbrella of computer science, is only gradually being gathered into survey publications for application by computer scientists [1,4,12,15]. Our purpose is to design a specification language which will serve as a vehicle for the design of and experimentation with user-computer interfaces. The specification language not only defines the external characteristics of the interface, but can also be analyzed to determine whether the interface meets a set of generally-accepted human factors guidelines. We believe the language is general enough to be used with principles of interface design other than those we have proposed.

This model allows the generation of synthetic images which have a depth of field, can be focused on an arbitrary plane, and also permits selective modeling of certain optical characteristics of a lens. The model can be expanded to include motion blur and special effect filters. These capabilities provide additional tools for highlighting important areas of a scene and for portraying certain physical characteristics of an object in an image.

Many phenomena that are difficult or impossible with other techniques are simple with ray tracing, including shadows, reflections, and refracted light. Ray directions, however, have been determined precisely, and this has limited the capabilities of ray tracing. By distributing the directions of the rays according to the analytic function they sample, ray tracing can incorporate fuzzy phenomena. This provides correct and easy solutions to some previously unsolved or partially solved problems, including motion blur, depth of field, penumbras, translucency, and fuzzy reflections. Motion blur and depth of field calculations can be integrated with the visible surface calculations, avoiding the problems found in previous methods.

The system, called the Pilot's Associate (PA), besides the pilot's inputs, required in its knowledge bases expertise from human-factors specialists to decide how the information should be displayed, from psychologists to establish benchmarks for pilot performance in combat, and from engineers to define the relevant operational characteristics that need to be monitored by the expert system. It was designed to make expert recommendations without stopping to quiz pilots during air-to-air combat. The key to the system architecture is a plan-goal graph, which describes the elements used to link a pilot's actions, or plans, with a particular mission goal. The plan-goal graph is described, and a simple example is given to illustrate its use. The tasks of reconciling differing design requirements and of finding effective ways to communicate, both among human designers and among the software modules themselves, are discussed

Genomic data generated by molecular biologists is analyzed by algorithms that search for similarity to known sequences in large genomic databases. The output from these algorithms can be several thousand pages of text, and is difficult to analyze because of its length and complexity. We developed and implemented a novel graphical representation for sequence similarity search results, which visually reveals features that are difficult to find in textual reports. The method opens new possibilities in the interpretation of this discrete, multi-dimensional data by enabling interactive investigation of the graphical representation.

It is a mechanism for interactively selecting subsets of the data so that they may be highlighted, deleted, or masked. Traditionally, brushes have been defined in screen space via methods such as painting and rubberband rectangles. In this paper we describe the design of N-dimensional brushes which are defined in data space rather than screen space, and show how they have been integrated into XmdvTool, a visualization package for displaying multivariate data. Depending on the data display technique in use, brushes may be specified and manipulated via direct or indirect methods, and the specification may be demand-driven or data-driven. Various brush operations such as highlighting, linking, masking, moving average, and quantitative display have been developed to apply to the selected data. In addition, we have explored several new brush concepts, such as non-discrete brush boundaries, simultaneous display of multiple brushes, and creating composite brushes via logical operators. Preliminary experimental evaluation with test subjects supports the usefulness of N-dimensional brushes in data exploration tasks.
acm833846	Recursive Pattern: A Technique for Visualizing Very Large Amounts of Data	acm832271	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the 6th conference on Visualization '95	279	null	Visualizing Large Data Sets, Visualizing Multidimensional and Multivariate Data, Visualizing Large Sequential Data Sets, Recursive Visualization Techniques, Interfaces to Databases	3	P58960	1995	19	An important goal of visualization technology is to support the exploration and analysis of very large amounts of data. In this paper, we propose a new visualization technique called `recursive pattern' which has been developed for visualizing large amounts of multidimensional data. The technique is based on a generic recursive scheme which generalizes a wide range of pixel-oriented arrangements for displaying large data sets. By instantiating the technique with adequate data- and application-dependent parameters, the user may largely influence the structure of the resulting visualizations. Since the technique uses one pixel for presenting each data value, the amount of data which can be displayed is only limited by the resolution of current display technology and by the limitations of human perceptibility. Beside describing the basic idea of the `recursive pattern' technique, we provide several examples of useful parameter settings for the various recursion levels. We further show that our `recursive pattern ' technique is particularly advantageous for the large class of data sets which have a natural order according to one dimension (e.g. time series data). We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique by using a stock market application.

Feature extraction is viewed as a process of data abstraction, which can proceed in multiple stages, and corresponding data abstraction levels. The features are represented by attribute sets, which play a key role in the visualization process. Icons are symbolic parametric objects, designed as visual representations of features. The attributes are mapped to the parameters (or degrees of freedom) of an icon. We describe some generic techniques to generate attribute sets, such as volume integrals and medial axis transforms. A simple but powerful modeling language was developed to create icons, and to link the attributes to the icon parameters. We present illustrative examples of iconic visualization created with the techniques described, showing the effectiveness of this approach.

We have implemented a prototype called AVE (Automatic Visualization Environment) that generates diagrams automatically based on a generative theory of diagram design. According to this theory, diagrams are constructed based on the data to be visualized rather than by selection from a predefined set of diagrams. This approach can be applied to knowledge represented by semantic networks. We give a brief introduction to the underlying theory, then describe the implementation and finally discuss strategies for extending the algorithm
acm833884	An Architecture for Retaining and Analyzing Visual Explorations of Databases	acm832271	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the 6th conference on Visualization '95	101	108	visual database exploration, database visualization, metadata, user modeling, interaction	2	P465743	11-1995	6	A software architecture is presented to integrate a database management system with data visualization. One of its primary objectives, the retention of user-data interactions, is detailed. By storing all queries over the data along with high-level descriptions of the query results and the associated visualization, the processes by which a database is explored can be analyzed. This approach can lead to important contributions in the development of user models as data explorers, metadata models for scientific databases, intelligent assistants and data exploration services. We describe the underlying elements of this approach, specifically the visual database exploration model and the metadata objects that support the model.

This paper is concerned with the authenticity issues of the data decomposition, particularly for data visualization. A total of six datasets are used to clarify the approximation characteristics of compactly supported orthogonal wavelets. We present an error tracking mechanism, which uses the available wavelet resources to measure the quality of the wavelet approximations

CAT augments the expressive power of Web pages for publishing passive multimedia information with a full-fledged interactive algorithm animation system. It improves on previous Web-based algorithm animations by providing a framework that makes it easy to construct new animations, including those that involve multiple views. Because views of the same running algorithm may reside on different machines, CAT is particularly well-suited for electronic classrooms. This strategy is an improvement over the electronic classroom systems the authors are aware of which simply display the same X window on multiple machines. They believe their framework generalizes to electronic textbooks in arbitrary domains

But this is only a starting point in trying to understand the rich and varied set of information visualizations that have been proposed in recent years. The paper offers a task by data type taxonomy with seven data types (one, two, three dimensional data, temporal and multi dimensional data, and tree and network data) and seven tasks (overview, zoom, filter, details-on-demand, relate, history, and extracts)

Direct manipulations of the tabular layout may or may not result in the desired changes to the formulas. The user is forced to explore the individual cells to find, verify, and modify the formulas, which causes heavy cognitive overhead. We present a set of techniques that make these formulas and their resulting dataflow structure easily accessible while maintaining the natural appearance of the spreadsheet. Transient local views visualize dataflow structures associated with individual cells, while static global views and animated global explanations visually present the entire dataflow structure at once. Semantic navigation enables the user to navigate through the dataflow structure interactively, and visual editing techniques make it possible to construct formulas using graphical editing techniques. Central to these techniques is the use of animation and lightweight interaction for rapid and non-intrusive visualization. Our prototype implementation suggests that these techniques can greatly improve the expressive power of current spreadsheets as well as other applications that have rich underlying structures

VIQING provides a simple graphical interface for connecting visualizations, and has the expressive power of the basic relational operators select, project and join. VIQING has been implemented in the Tioga DataSplash visualization system to provide a seamless integration of querying and browsing. The resulting system is unique in providing a unified visual interface for developing database applications, encompassing both querying and data visualization

We have performed a comparative study of three 3D information visualizations as a step towards a better understanding of this. The study involved 25 volunteer subjects, performing three different tasks with the Information Landscape, Cam Tree, and Information Cube. The results of the study indicate that the subjects were significantly faster with the Information Landscape when compared with both other visualizations. The Cam Tree was significantly faster than the Information Cube. Our observations during the study indicate that local and global overview are extremely important factors. We also observed that custom navigation is crucial in 3D user interfaces. Finally, the study raises the question: for what types of tasks is a 3D user interface best suited?

Incorporating more traditional information storage and retrieval technologies into its design, the STARLIGHT system also enables the integrated use of multiple, concurrent visualization techniques to support comparison of content and interrelationship information levels of abstraction simultaneously. This powerful new form of information analysis eases cognitive workloads by providing a visual context for the information under study. Originally developed for intelligence analysis applications, the STARLIGHT software is intended to support the rapid, concurrent analysis of complex multimedia information, including structured and unstructured text, geographic information, and digital imagery. The system uses novel 3-D visualization techniques that interactively generate easily understandable representations of explicit and implicit relationships contained in information collections of various types. This paper describes the general theory behind our approach, and the design and features of a Windows NT-based operational system

However, there is little research into the provision of software architectures for visualization systems to reduce this difficulty. Particularly, systems that provide a reusable support for the automatic management of the different levels of abstraction in which complex data can be observed cannot be found in current visualization systems. Telescope, an object-oriented architecture for visualization systems is presented. Its main goal is to provide a customizable infrastructure to develop visualization systems allowing the automatic management of the different levels of abstraction in which the visualized information can be observed. Telescope is based on the concept of abstractor objects which provides the generic behavior to support visualizations with semantic zoom capabilities controlled externally through abstraction scales. CityVis, a visualization system for city data, developed using the Telescope architecture, is also described

Information visualization can be used to explore relationships by drilling down and retrieving more data within a region of interest in the visualized data, combining data mining, direct manipulation and data visualization with 3D Web tools. It is now possible to create desktop visualization applications that let users interact with databases with larger datasets over the network using both 2D and 3D interaction metaphors. The VRML standard allows users to view and navigate through 3D information data worlds and hyperlink to new worlds. Information drilling based on HTML's image map, VRML's anchor node and multiple predefined viewpoints is explained and demonstrated. The image map in 2D and 3D graphics objects (glyphs, etc.) represents the visual user interface to the information stored in the database. Over the next couple of years, we shall see 3D visualization evolve in giant steps into interactive data drilling on the Web, providing visualization technology closely integrated with the data warehouse and multidimensional abstract and geospatial data models

This paper presents the macroscope, an interactive technique for browsing very large spaces of displayed information at different scales. The macroscope takes as a point of departure the traditional 2D zoom and pan operations, but introduces multiple translucent layers to avoid the problem of losing visual context. The third dimension is used to visually separate the layers and provide an external point of view for controlling the presentation. The user can manipulate viewfinders in the virtual space, which control the relative scale and position of the layers

The second edition of Thomsen's classic OLAP Solutions provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of the concepts and best techniques for deploying OLAP -- no matter what tools you're using. This edition is thoroughly revised, offering expanded coverage of logical issues such as dimensional hierarchies, as well as physical issues of data storage, access, and calculation. Thomsen has also created an entirely new application section that provides a computational cross-value chain model of ten interconnected business processes within the context of a manufacturing company. The practical methods and formulas you'll learn are useful no matter what commercial OLAP tool(s) you use.

A fisheye view of a graph shows an area of interest quite large and with detail and shows other areas successively smaller and in less detail. It achieves this smooth integration of local detail and global context by repositioning and resizing elements of the graph. A fisheye lens seems to have all the advantages of the other approaches for viewing and browsing a graph without any of the drawbacks.

It makes use of three-dimensional space to display more information than is possible in two dimensions. It employs animation and interactive selection to create a focal point on the structure. Shadows and perspective serve to enhance the effect. In this paper, we describe an implementation of cone trees under the UGA graphics architecture. The implementation is in the FLESH language -- an object-oriented graphics language that is the core of the UGA system. The FLESH language allows for rapid prototyping of three-dimensional widgets such as this. In addition to the rapid implementation, several extensions of the vanilla Xerox trees were implemented. A critique of the cone tree is offered, as well as suggestions for future direction of visualization of hierarchical data sets.

This paper describes a system for viewing and browsing planar graphs using a software analog of a fisheye lens. We first show how to implement such a view using solely geometric transformations. We then describe a more general transformation that allows hierarchical, structured information about the graph to modify the views. Our general transformation is a fundamental extension to the previous research in fisheye views.

Examples include circuit schematics and diagrams for information systems analysis and design.

Research on this topic is spread over the broad spectrum of computer science. This bibliography constitutes a first attempt to encompass both theoretical and application-oriented papers from disparate areas.

Although a handful of algorithm animation systems have been developed in recent years, relatively little work has been done on the theoretical foundations of such systems. In this work we develop a conceptual framework with formal models and precise semantics for algorithm animation. The framework contains facilities for defining operations in an algorithm, designing animations, and mapping the algorithm operations to their corresponding animations. We introduce the framework to make animation design easier, as well as to provide a model that supports smooth, continuous image movement. We also present the {\em path-transition} paradigm that simplifies the animation design process. Concurrently, we develop an algorithm animation system called TANGO (Transition-based Animation Generation) based upon the framework. TANGO supports two-dimensional color animations in a window-based workstation environment. It provides programmers with the capabilities to produce sophisticated, real-time views of their programs with a minimum of graphics coding. Using TANGO, programmers create animations by writing routines in an algorithm animation design language or by using a direct-manipulation, demonstrational animation design tool.

Relatively little work has been done in exploring how to best utilize the third dimension to increase visualization capabilities beyond simply increasing the volume of data presented. This paper prsents a design principle that enriches the amount of semantic information that could be visualized by treating the third dimension not so much as one of three equivalent dimensions in three-space but as an independent channel of information.

Aids must then be provided to the user that permit collection browsing and make it possible to locate particular items on demand. The conventional text analysis methods based on preconstructed knowledge-bases and other vocabulary-control tools are difficult to apply when the subject coverage is unrestricted. An alternative approach, applicable to text collections in any subject area, is introduced which uses the document collections themselves as a basis for the text analysis, together with sophisticated text matching operations carried out at several levels of detail. Methods are described for relating semantically similar pieces of text, and for using the resulting hypertext structures for collection browsing and information retrieval.

This result is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. Typical evaluation results are shown demonstrating the usefulness of the model.

Using trees for information visualisation requires novel user interface techniques, visual clues, and navigational aids. This paper describes a visual clue for trees as well as an automatic folding (clustering) technique, both based on some mathematical concepts and results in combinatorics. Examples are shown how these techniques can be used, and what the further challenges in this area are.

These factors, availability, efficiency, and utility, are then used to explain the variations in performance that occur with different processor and memory system features. The processor features that are investigated are branch prediction depth and following multiple branch paths. The memory system features that are investigated are cache size, associativity, miss penalty, and memory bus bandwidth. Dynamic scheduling with appropriate levels of bus bandwidth and branch prediction is shown to be remarkably effective at achieving good performance over a range of differing application types and over a range of cache miss rates. These results were obtained using a new simulation environment, MXS, which directly executes the benchmarks.
acm892623	Using Complete Machine Simulation to Understand Computer System Behavior	acm892623	Stanford University Technical Report CS-TR-98-1603		null	complete machine simulation	1	P595681	1998	0	This dissertation describes complete machine simulation, a novel approach to understanding the behavior of modern computer systems. Complete machine simulation models all of the hardware found in modern computer systems, allowing it to investigate the behavior of highly configurable machines running commercial operating systems and important workloads such as database and web servers. Complete machine simulation extends the applicability of traditional machine simulation techniques by addressing speed and data organization challenges. To achieve the speed needed to investigate long-running workloads, complete machine simulation allows an investigator to dynamically adjust the characteristics of its hardware simulation. An investigator can select a high-speed, low-detail simulation setting to quickly pass through uninteresting portions of a workload''s execution. Once the workload has reached a more interesting execution state, an investigator can switch to slower, more detailed simulation to obtain behavioral information. To efficiently organize low-level hardware simulation data into more useful information, complete machine simulation provides several mechanisms that incorporate higher-level workload knowledge into the data management process. These mechanisms are efficient and further improve simulation speed by customizing all data collection and reporting to the specific needs of an investigation.

Two layout algorithms were implemented. A hierarchical graph layout algorithm was found to be best for directed graphs. The graph browser also has facilities that allow it to be integrated with other applications (e.g., a program browser or a database design tool). These facilities and our experiences building a program call-graph browser are described.

Therefore, many users resort to the drawing facilites available on most personal computers, but the figures obtained in this way still look ``hand-drawn"; their quality is inferior to the quality of the surrounding text that can be realized by today''s high quality text processing systems. In this paper we present an entirely new solution that integrates a tree drawing algorithm into one of the best text processing systems available. More precisely, we present a TeX macro package TreeTeX that produces a drawing of a tree from a purely logical description. Our approach has three advantages. First, labels for nodes can be handled in a reasonable way. On the one hand, the tree drawing algorithm can compute the widths of the labels and take them into account for the positioning of the nodes; on the other hand, all the textual parts of the document can be treated uniformly. Second, TreeTeX can be trivially ported to any site running TeX. Finally, modularity in the description of a tree and TeX''s macro capabilities allow for libraries of subtrees and tree classes. In addition, we have implemented an option that produces drawing which make the {\em structure\/} of the trees more obvious to the human eye, even though they may not be as aesthetically pleasing.

Mocha is a distributed model with a client-server architecture that optimally partitions the software components of a typical algorithm animation system, and leverages the power of the Java language, an emerging standard for distributing interactive platform-independent applications across the Web.Mocha provides high levels of security, protects the algorithm code, places a light communication load on the Internet, and allows users with limited computing resources to access animations of computationally expensive algorithms. The user interface combines fast responsiveness and user friendliness with the powerful authoring capabilities of hypertext narratives.We describe the architecture of Mocha and show its advantages over previous methods for algorithm animation over the Internet. We also present a prototype of an animation system for geometric algorithms that can be accessed by any user with a WWW browser supporting Java (currently Netscape 2.0 and HotJava) at URL http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/jib/Mocha.html.

This work is an extension of the DataSplash database visulaization environment. DataSplash is a direct manipulation system in which users can construct and navigate visualizations. Objects' appearances change as users zoom closer to or further away from the visualization. Users specify graphically the point at which these changes occur.Our experience with DataSplash indicates that users find it difficult to construct visualizations that display an appropriate amount of detail. In this paper, we introduce an extension to DataSplash based on the Principle of Constant Information Density. This extension gives users feedback about the density of visualizations as they create them. We also introduce an extension that suggests improvements to existing visualizations.We have performed an informal study of user navigation in applications with and without constant information density. We suggest that designers take density into account when designing applications to avoid biasing user navigation in unexpected ways.

With multiple processor workstations available in the 10-30 Mflop range, we feel that these new developments in scientific computing warrant a new approach to the design and implementation of analysis tools. These larger, more complex problems create a need for new visualization techniques not possible with the existing software or systems available as of this writing and these visualization techniques will change as the supercomputing environment, and hence the scientific methods employed, evolve even further.Visualization of computational aerodynamics requires flexible, extensible, and adaptable software tools for performing analysis tasks. Flexible means the ability to handle a diverse range of problems. Extensible means the ability to interact at all levels of the software hierarchy, either through existing built-in functionality or through the implementation of custom "plug-in" modules. Adaptable means the ability to adapt to new software and hardware configurations through the use of modular structured programming methods, a graphics library standard, and the use of common network communication protocols (like UNIX sockets) for the distribution of processing.This paper discusses FAST (Flow Analysis Software Toolkit), an implementation of a software system for fluid mechanics analysis that is based on this approach.

This paper describes an approach to this problem based on a classification of visualization techniques that is independent of particular application domains. A user breaks up a problem into subproblems, describes these subproblems in terms of the objects to be represented and the operations to be supported by a representation, locates applicable visualization techniques in a catalog, and combines these representation into a composite representation for the original problem. The catalog and its underlying classification provide a way for workers in different application disciplines to share methods.

In this paper we present a simple and flexible method of shape coding for higher dimensional data sets that allows the database operator or discipline scientist quick access to promising patterns within and among records or samples. The example used is a thirteen parameter set of solar wind, magnetosphere, and ground observation data collected hourly for twenty-one days in 1976.

In particular, cases where the number of independent variables is three or greater are discussed. A new hierarchical method of plotting that allows one to interactively view millions of data points with up to 10 independent variables is presented. The technique is confined to the case where each independent variable is sampled in a regular grid or lattice-like fashion, i.e., in equal increments. The proposed technique can be described in either an active or a passive manner. In the active view the points of the N-dimensional independent variables lattice are mapped to a single horizontal axis in a hierarchical manner, while in the passive view an observer samples the points of the N -dimensional lattice in a prescribed fashion and notes the values of the dependent variable. In the passive view a plot of the dependent variable versus a single parametric variable, which is simply the sampling number, forms the multidimensional graph.

It is based on a system of parallel coordinates which induces a nonprojective mapping between N-dimensional and two-dimensional sets. Hypersurfaces are represented by their planar images which have some geometrical properties analogous to the properties of the hypersurface that they represent. A pointline duality when N=2 generalizes to lines and hyperplanes enabling the representation of polyhedra in R^N. The representation of a class of convex and non-convex hypersurfaces is discussed, together with an algorithm for constructing and displaying any interior point. The display shows some local properties of the hypersurface and provides information on the point's proximity to the boundary. Applications are discussed.
acm949614	A tool for visualizing the topology of three-dimensional vector fields	acm949607	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the 2nd conference on Visualization '91	33	40	null	3	P643517	1991	3	A description is given of a software system, TOPO, taht numerically analyzes and graphically displays topological aspects of a three-dimensional vector field, v, to produce a single, relatively simple picture that characterizes v. The topology of v considered consists of its critical points (where v = 0), their invariant manifolds, and the intergral curves connecting these invariant manifolds. The field in the neighborhood of each critical point is approximated by the Taylor expansion. The coefficients of the first nonzero term fo the taylor expansion around a critical point are the 3x3 matrix delta-v. Critical ppoints are classified by examining delta-v's eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of delta-v span the invariant manifolds of the linearized field around a critical point. Curves integrated from initial points on the eigen vectors a small distance from the critical point connect with other critical points (or the boundary) to complete the topology. One class of critical surfaces that is important in computational fluid dynamics is analyzed.
acm949633	Interactive data visualization using focusing and linking	acm949607	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the 2nd conference on Visualization '91	156	163	graphical data analysis methods, geographic information system, interactive data visualization, time series analysis	4	P17277	1991	8	Two basic principles for interactive visualization of high-dimensional data-focusing and linking-are discussed. Focusing techniques may involve selecting subsets, dimension reduction, or some more general manipulation of the layout information on the page or screen. A consequent of focusing is that each view only conveys partial information about the data and needs to be linked so that the information contained in individual views can be integrated into a coherent image of the data as a whole. Examples are given of how graphical data analysis methods based on focusing and linking are used in applications including linguistics, geographic information systems, time series analysis, and the analysis of multi-channel images arising in radiology and remote sensing.
acm949654	Tree-Maps a space-filling approach to the visualization of hierarchical information structures	acm949607	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the 2nd conference on Visualization '91	284	291	computer graphics, data analysis, display space, hierarchical information structures, tree-map visualization technique.	2	P32711	1991	14	A method for visualizing hierarchically structured information is described. The tree-map visualization technique makes 100% use of the available display space, mapping the full hierarchy onto a rectangular region in a space-filling manner. This efficient use of space allows very large hierarchies to be displayed in their entirety and facilitates the presentation of semantic information. Tree-maps can depict both the structure and content of the hierarchy. However, the approach is best suited to hierarchies in which the content of the leaf nodes and the structure of the hierarchy are of primary importance, and the content information associated with internal nodes is largely derived from their children.

The technique is to make a reduced picture of code with the line execution counts identified with color. Hot spots are shown in red, warm spots in orange, and so on. It is possible to identify nonexecuted code and nonexecutable code such as declarations and static tables.

As examples of such graphical displays, two simulation results of using a Kohonen feature map to generate map displays for information retrieval are presented and discussed. The map displays are a mapping from a high-dimensional document space to a two-dimensional space. They show document relationships by various visual cues, such as dots, links, clusters, and areas, as well as their measurement and spatial arrangement. Using the map displays as an interface for document retrieval systems, the user is provided with richer visual information to support browsing and searching.

A popular technique for volume rendering is known as splatting. With new hardware architectures offering substantial improvements in the performance of rendering texture mapped objects, we present textured splats. An ideal reconstruction function for 3D signals is developed which can be used as a texture map for a splat. Extensions to the basic splatting technique are then developed to additionally represent vector fields.

In this paper, we present a family of iterated function systems (IFS) that can be used to generate a set of visual models of a DNA sequence. A new visualization function, the W-curve, that is derived from this IFS family is introduced. Using W-curves, a user can readily compare subsequences within a long genomic sequence - or between genomic sequences - and can visually evaluate the effect of local variations (mutations) upon the global genomic information content.
acm951144	A lattice model for data display	acm951087	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the conference on Visualization '94	310	317	complex information processing, data display, data objects, data visualization, lattice isomorphisms, lattice model	3	P299190	1994	9	n order to develop a foundation for visualization, we develop lattice models for data objects and displays that focus on the fact that data objects are approximations to mathematical objects and real displays are approximations to ideal displays. These lattice models give us a way to quantize the information content of data and displays and to define conditions on the visualization mappings from data to displays. Mappings satisfy these conditions if and only if they are lattice isomorphisms. We show how to apply this result to scientific data and display models, and discuss how it might be applied to recursively defined data types appropriate for complex information processing.
acm951146	XmdvTool integrating multiple methods for visualizing multivariate data	acm951087	IEEE Visualization: Proceedings of the conference on Visualization '94	326	333	n-dimensional brush, data visualization, physical phenomena, integral multiple methods, multivariate data, spatial relationships	1	P194710	1994	6	Much of the attention in visualization research has focussed on data rooted in physical phenomena, which is generally limited to three or four dimensions. However, many sources of data do not share this dimensional restriction. A critical problem in the analysis of such data is providing researchers with tools to gain insights into characteristics of the data, such as anomalies and patterns. Several visualization methods have been developed to address this problem, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. This paper describes a system named XmdvTool which integrates several of the most common methods for projecting multivariate data onto a two-dimensional screen. This integration allows users to explore their data in a variety of formats with ease. A view enhancement mechanism called an N-dimensional brush is also described. The brush allows users to gain insights into spatial relationships over N dimensions by highlighting data which falls within a user-specified subspace.
acm951894	CartoDraw A Fast Algorithm for Generating Contiguous Cartograms	acm951847	IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics: Volume 10 , Issue 1 (January 2004): 	95	110	Information visualization, visualization of geo-related information, continuous cartograms, value-by-area cartograms, visualization and cartography.	3	P58960	2004	6	Cartograms are a well-known technique for showing geography-related statistical information, such as population demographics and epidemiological data. The basic idea is to distort a map by resizing its regions according to a statistical parameter, but in a way that keeps the map recognizable. In this study, we formally define a family of cartogram drawing problems. We show that even simple variants are unsolvable in the general case. Because the feasible variants are NP-complete, heuristics are needed to solve the problem. Previously proposed solutions suffer from problems with the quality of the generated drawings. For a cartogram to be recognizable, it is important to preserve the global shape or outline of the input map, a requirement that has been overlooked in the past. To address this, our objective function for cartogram drawing includes both global and local shape preservation. To measure the degree of shape preservation, we propose a shape similarity function, which is based on a Fourier transformation of the polygonsÕ curvatures. Also, our application is visualization of dynamic data, for which we need an algorithm that recalculates a cartogram in a few seconds. None of the previous algorithms provides adequate performance with an acceptable level of quality for this application. In this paper, we therefore propose an efficient iterative scanline algorithm to reposition edges while preserving local and global shapes. Scanlines may be generated automatically or entered interactively to guide the optimization process more closely. We apply our algorithm to several example data sets and provide a detailed comparison of the two variants of our algorithm and previous approaches. 
acm97273	Data characterization for intelligent graphics presentation	acm97243	Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems Empowering people	193	200	Interaction Techniques, Models and Principles, Graphics Editors, Document and Text Processing	2	P270271	1990	7	An automatic presentation system is an intelligent interface component which receives information from a user or application program and designs a combination of graphics and text that effectively conveys it. It is a facility that assumes the presentation responsibilities for other programs. An important research question has been how information should be specified or described by an application program for it to be presented by an automatic presenter. This paper proposes a taxonomy of information characteristics which would need to be provided to either human or computer designers for them to create presentations reflecting the individual needs of a diverse group of users. The proposed taxonomy of characteristics defines the representational goals for intelligent interfaces which reason about graphical displays.
acm97898	Rapid controlled movement through a virtual 3D workspace	acm97879	International Conference on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques: Proceedings of the 17th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques: ACM SIGGRAPH Computer Graphics: Volume 24 , Issue 4 (August 1990)	171	176	Interaction Techniques, User Interfaces, Viewpoint movement, object movement, virtual reality, interactive graphics, 3D graphics, logarithmic motion, 3D workspaces.	3	P141917	1990	11	Computer graphics hardware supporting real-time interactive 3D animation has the potential to support effective user interfaces by enabling virtual 3D workspaces. However, this potential requires development of viewpoint movement techniques that support rapid and controlled movement through workspaces. Rapid movement through large distances avoids wasted work time; controlled movement near taget objects allows the user to examine and interact with objects in the workspace. Current techiques for viewpoint movement typically use high velocities to cover distances rapidly, but high velocities are hard to control near objects. This paper describes a new technique for targeted viewpoint movement that solves this problem. The key idea is to have the user indicate a point of interest (target) on a 3D object and use the distance to this target to move the viewpoint logarithmically, by moving the same relative percentage of distance to the target on every animation cycle. The result is rapid motion over distances that slows as the viewpoint approaches the target object. The technique can be used with 2D and multidimensional input devices. We also extend the technique to move objects in the workspace.

It takes advantage of the fact that confolution can be thought of as distributing energy from input samples into space. The renderer calculates an image plane footprint for each data sample and uses the footprint to spread the sample's energy onto the image plane. A result of the technique is that the forward mapping algorithm can support perspective without excessive cost, and support adaptive resampling of the three-dimensional data set during image generation.

Our design, modeled in part after the hierarchical 2D windows of the X Window System, is intended to provide an environment that is well suited to the use of true 3D input and stereo display devices. Boxes are associated with event handlers that support 3D motion, enter, and leave events, and provide recognition of finger gestures.

We describe a programming model for direct manipulation in general and for painting in particular, based on simple constraints between entities in an the underlying scientific database and the components of displays used to examine the data. With this model, the original notion of "brushing scatterplots" is easily extended.
acm98599	Computing the minimum Hausdorff distance for point sets under translation	acm98524	Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry: Proceedings of the sixth annual symposium on Computational geometry	340	349	Geometrical Problems and Computations, Pattern Matching	2	P58912	1990	5	We consider the problem of computing a translation that minimizes the Hausdorff distance between two sets of points. For points in R1 in the worst case there are O(mn) translations at which the Hausdorff distance is a local minimum, where m is the number of points in one set and n is the number in the other. For points in R2 there are O(mn(m + n)) such local minima. We show how to compute the minimal Hausdorff distance in time O(mn log mn) for points in R1 and in time O(m2n2) A(mn)) for points in R2. The results for the one-dimensional case are applied to the problem of comparing polygons under general affine transformations, where we extend the recent results of Arkin et al on polygon resemblance under rigid body motion. The two-dimensional case is closely related to the problem of finding an approximate congruence between two points sets under translation in the plane, as considered by Alt et al.

A field study conducted over six weeks at the UNC-CH Computer Science Department showed VS to be a generally useful system and provided valuable feedback on ways to enhance the functionality of the system to increase its value as a groupwork tool. In particular, users found priority-based time-slots and access to scheduling decision reasoning advantageous. VS has been in use by more than 75 faculty, staff, and graduate students since Fall 1987.
